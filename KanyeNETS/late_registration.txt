Oh, whoa ho ho
I knew I was gon' see, knew I was gon' you again
Knew I was gon' see you again
Where your goddamn book bag at?
Always carryin' that little book bag, nobody wants to see that
Goddamn fourth grader, sit your ass down
He wanna play it again like he got somethin' else to do
You ain't got somethin' else to do
You ain't doin' nothin' with your life, nothin' with your life
You think this is?
You better look at me when I'm talkin' to you
You think this shit easy, don't you?
You think this is promised
Well ain't nothin' promised to you
Look at my face, do I got a promised face?
Does it look like I promised you anything?
Kanye, nigga, is you snorin' in my class?
Wake up Mr. West
Wake up Mr. West
Mr. West
Mr. West
Mr. West


Uh, yeah
Uh, yeah
Uh, yeah
Uh, yeah

And I heard 'em say
"Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today"
From the Chi, like Tim it's a harder way
So this is in the name of love like Robert say
Before you ask me to go get a job today
Can I at least get a raise of the minimum wage?
And I know that the government administer AIDS
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
Allahu Akbar and throw him some hot cars
Things we see on the screen that's not ours
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far
Where I'm from the dope boys is the rock stars
But they can't cop cars without seeing cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars, I know it


Uh, and I heard 'em say
"Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today"
And I heard 'em say
"Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today"
But we'll a find a way
(And nothing last forever but be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way)


They say people in your life are seasons
And anything that happen is for a reason
And niggas gun clapping and keep to squeezing
And gram keep praying and keep believing
In Jesus, and one day that you see him
Till they walk in his footsteps and try to be him
The devil is alive I feel him breathin'
Claiming money is the key, so keep on dreamin'
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us
My Aunt Pam can't put them cigarettes down
So now my little cousin smokin' them cigarettes now
His job try to claim that he too niggerish now
Is it 'cause his skin blacker than licorice now?
I can't figure it out, I'm sick of it now


Uh, and I heard 'em say
"Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today"
And I heard 'em say
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
But we'll a find a way
(And nothing last forever but be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way)


With every worthless word, we get more far away
And nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
And nothing last forever but be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way
I gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'mma touch the sky
Gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'mma touch the sky

Back when they thought pink Polos would hurt the Roc
Before Cam got the shit to pop, the doors was closed
I felt like Bad Boy's street team, I couldn't work the LOX
Now let's go, take 'em back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in that U-Haul van
Any pessimists I ain't talk to them
Plus I ain't have no phone in my apart-a-ment
Let's take 'em back to the club
Least about an hour I stand on line, I just wanted to dance
I went to Jacob an hour after I got my advance, I just wanted to shine
Jay favorite line, "Dawg, in due time"
Now he look at me, like, "Damn, dawg, you where I am"
A hip hop legend, I think I died
In that accident, 'cause this must be heaven

I gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'm a touch the sky
Gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'mma touch the sky

Now let's take 'em high-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh la la la la la la la
(Top of the world, baby, top top of the world)
(Top of the world, baby, on top of the world)
Now let's take 'em high-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh la la la la la la la
(Top of the world, baby, top top of the world)
(Top of the world, baby, on top of the world) Uh

Back when Gucci was the shit to rock
Back when Slick Rick got the shit to pop
I'd do anything to say I got it
Damn, them new loafers hurt my pocket
Before anybody wanted K. West beats, me and my girl split the buffet at KFC
Dog, I was having nervous breakdowns like, "Man, these niggas that much better than me?"
Baby, I'm going on an aeroplane and I don't know if I'll be back again
Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets but when she came to kick it, things became different
Any girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on
Couldn't keep it at home, thought I needed a Nia Long
I'm trying to right my wrongs but it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song, now

I gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gonna touch the sky
You gonna touch the sky baby girl
Testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gonna touch the sky


Yes, yes, yes
Guess who's on third?
Lupe steal like Lupin the 3rd
Here like ear till I'm beer on the curb
Peach fuzz buzz but beard on the verge
Let's slow it down like we're on the syrup
Bottle shaped body like Mrs. Butterworth
But, before you say another word
I'm back on the block like I'm laying on the street
I'm trying to stop lion like I'm Mumm-Ra
But I'm not lyin' when I'm laying on the beat
En garde, or touch√©, Lupe cool as the unthawed
But I still feel possessed as a gun charge
Come as correct as a porn star
In a fresh pair steps in my best foreign car
So, I represent the first
Now let me end my verse right where the horns are like uh


I gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gonna touch the sky
You gonna touch the sky baby girl
Testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gonna touch the sky

We back at home, baby
Sky high
I'm, I'm sky high
I'm, I'm sky high
I'm, I'm sky high
I'm, I'm sky high
I'm, I'm sky high
Sky, uh, sky high
I'm, I'm sky high

Yeah
Keep it rollin'
Yeah
Uh, feels good to be home, baby
Feels good to be home
She take my money when I'm in need
Yeah she's a triflin' friend indeed
Oh, she's a gold digger, way over town
That digs on me


Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger

But she ain't messin' wit' no broke niggas


Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger

But she ain't messin' wit' no broke niggas

 Get down girl, go 'head get down
 Get down girl, go 'head get down
 Get down girl, go 'head get down
 Get down girl, go 'head

Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said, I can tell you rock, I can tell by your charm
Far as girls you got a flock, I can tell by your charm

And your arm, but I'm lookin' for the one. Have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have an ass like Serena
Trina, Jeena-fah Lopez, four kids
And I gotta take all they bad ass to ShowBiz

Okay, get your kids, but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to din and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl then you better be paid

You know why? It take too much to touch her
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
My best friend said she used to fuck with Usher
I don't care what none of y'all say, I still love her


Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger, uh

But she ain't messin' wit' no broke niggas, uh


Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger, uh

But she ain't messin' wit' no broke niggas, uh

 Get down girl, go 'head get down
 Get down girl, go 'head get down
 Get down girl, go 'head get down
 Get down girl, go 'head

Eighteen years, eighteen years
She got one of yo' kids, got you for eighteen years
I know somebody payin' child support for one of his kids
His baby mama car and crib is bigger than his

You will see him on TV, any given Sunday
Win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money
She went to the doctor got lipo with your money

She walkin' around lookin' like Michael with your money
Should've got that insured, GEICO for your money 
If you ain't no punk
Holla we want prenup (We want prenup!)

Yeah, it's something that you need to have
'Cause when she leave your ass she gon' leave with half
Eighteen years, eighteen years
And on her eighteenth birthday, he found out it wasn't his


Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger, uh

But she ain't messin' wit' no broke niggas, uh


Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger, uh

But she ain't messin' wit' no broke niggas, uh

 Get down girl, go 'head get down, uh
 Get down girl, go 'head get down
 Get down girl, go 'head get down, uh
 Get down girl, go 'head

Now I ain't sayin' you a gold digger, you got needs
You don't want a dude to smoke but he can't buy weed
You got out to eat and he can't pay, y'all can't leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves

But while y'all washin', watch him
He gon' make it into a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition, baby, look at his eyes
This week he moppin' floors, next week it's the fries

So, stick by his side
I know there's dude's ballin', but yeah that's nice
And they gon' keep callin' and tryin', but you stay right, girl
And when you get on, he leave yo' ass for a white girl

 Get down girl, go 'head get down
 Get down girl, go 'head get down
 Get down girl, go 'head get down
 Get down girl, go 'head
I brought you brothers here to start our own fraternity
Broke Phi Broke, we ain't got it.
Broke Phi Broke (we ain't got it)
No, we have no money 
We are sharin' jeans.
If I go outside, I got the only clothing on.
How many cars do we own? (None!)
How many cars do we own? (None, sir!)
Should we let our woman go and be with the cat in the car?
Yes, we will.
Why? Because we can't afford gas. Say it with me!
(We can't afford no gas!)
Say it!
(We can't afford no gas!)
So we ain't drivin'!
Drive slow, homie
Drive slow, homie
You never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie

My homie Marley used to stay 79th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street from Calumet, a school for the Stones
He nicknamed me K-Rock so they would leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
And walked around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand
Keys in his hand, reason again to let you know he's the man
Back when we rocked Ellesses, he had dreams of Caprices
Drove by the teachers, even more by polices
How'd he get the cash? The day his father passed away
Left him with a little somethin, sixteen he was stuntin'
Al B. Sure nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit Lake Shore, girls go all crazy
Hit the freeway, go at least 'bout eighty
Boned so much that summer, even had him a baby
See back-back then-then, if you had a car
You was the Chi-Town version of Baby
And I was just a virgin, a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
We'd take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had they Lincolns and Auroras, we was hurtin 'em all
With the girls a lot of flirtin' involved, but dog
Fuck all that flirtin', I'm tryin' to get in some drawers
So put me on with these hoes, homie
He told me don't rush to get grown, drive slow, homie

Drive slow, homie
Drive slow
You never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie


What it do? I'm posted up in the parking lot, my trunk waving
The candy gloss is immaculate, it's simply amazing
Them elbows pokin' wide on that candy 'Lac
Trunk open, screens on, neons lit with fifth relaxed
I'm on a mission for dime-pieces and sexy ladies
Allow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes
It's a star-studded event when I valet park
Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark
You see them fours crawling? You see them screens falling?
The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin'
I'm leaning on the switch, sitting crooked in my slab
But I could still catch boppers if I drove a cab
A young Houston hard hitter all about the scrilla
Ridin' something candy coated, crawling like a caterpillar
I'm tipping on them fours, I'm jamming on that Screw
I'm looking for them hoes, baby, what it do? Drive slow, homie


Turn your hazard lights of when you see them hoes (Drive slow, homie)
If you're riding around the city with nowhere to go (Drive slow, homie)
Live today, 'cause tomorrow, man, you never know
(You never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie)

(My car's like the movie, my car's like the crib
I got more TVs in here than where I live)
And that don't make no sense, but baby, I'm the shit
And everything I flip, you know it's something serious
I got the custom grill, I got the Brabus rims
I got the baller genetics, baby, this evidence
You see a player flicking, and how you ain't convinced
That you should go on and kiss it, just a little bit (Just a little bit)
I got my custom kicks, I got my Jesus chain
My canaries is gleamin' through my angel wings
They see me, hoes actin like they seen a king
With that mean lean, smoking on that finest Cali green
My woodgrain oak, I'm ridin on Vogues
My cylinder quiet, like tip-toes
I sold O's, and this I know
When you see them hoes, little homie, drive slow


Yeah, drive slow, homie
Drive slow, homie
You never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie
Drive slow, homie
Yeah
(I'm on way home)


They say home is where the hate is, my dome is where fate is
I stroll where souls get lost like Vegas
Seen through the eyes of rebel glasses
Pray to God that my arms reach the masses
The young smoke grass in grassless jungles
Rubber band together in cashless bundles
We wear strugglin' chains, divided only hustle remains
Makin' sense of it, we hustle for change
Revolution ain't a game it's another name for life fightin'
Someone to stay in they corner like Mike Tyson
Hypes fightin' for hits to heighten they hell
Don't he know he could only get as high as he fell?
Show money becomes bail, relationships become jail
Children are unheld, I wish love was for sale
Behold the pale horse got me trapped like R. Kell, I bail and it


Might not be such a bad idea if I never, never went home again
I'm on my way home
I left three days ago, but no one seems to know I'm gone
Home is where the hatred is
Home is filled with pain and it
Might not be such a bad idea if I never, never went home again
That's that crack music nigga
That real black music nigga

(That's that crack music nigga
That real black music nigga)


How we stop the Black Panthers?
Ronald Reagan cooked up an answer
You hear that? What Gil Scott was hearing
When our heroes or heroines got hooked on heroin
Crack raised the murder rate in D.C. and Maryland
We invested in that, it's like we got Merrill lynched
And we been hangin' from the same tree ever since
Sometimes I feel the music is the only medicine
So we, cook it, cut it, measure it, bag it sell it
The fiends cop it, nowadays they can't tell if
That's that good shit, we ain't sure man
Put the CD on your tongue, yeah that's pure man


That's that crack music nigga
That real black music nigga

(That's that crack music nigga
That real black music nigga)


From the place where the father's gone, the mothers is hardly home
And the madigon's lock us up in the Audy Home
How the Mexicans say, we just tryin' to party holmes
They wanna pack us all in a box like styrofoam
Who gave Saddam anthrax?
George Bush got the answers
Back in the hood, it's a different type of chemical
Arm & Hammer baking soda raised they own quota
Right when our soldiers, ran for the stove 'cause
'Cause, dreams of being Hova
Went from bein' a broke man to bein' a dopeman
To bein' the President, look there's hope man
This that inspiration for the Moes and the Folks man
Shorty come and see his momma straight overdosin'
And this is the soundtrack
This the type of music that you make when you 'round that


Crack music nigga
That real black music nigga

(That's that crack music nigga
That real black music nigga)


God, how could you let this happen?
Happen, happen
Happen, happen
Happen


Uh, that's that crack music, crack music
That real black music, black music

(That's that crack music nigga
That real black music nigga)


That's that crack music, crack music
That real black music, black music


Our Father, give us this day, our daily bread
Before the feds give us these days and take our daily bread
See I done did all this ol' bullshit
And to atone, I throw a little somethin' somethin' on the pulpit
We took that shit, measured it and then cooked that shit
And what we gave back was crack music
And now we ooze it through they nooks and crannies
So our mamas ain't got to be they cooks and nannies
And we gon' repo everything they ever took from granny
Now the former slaves trade hooks for Grammys
This dark diction has become America's addiction
Those who ain't even black use it
We gon' keep baggin' up this here crack music
I know it's past visiting hours but can I please give her these flowers?
The doctor don't wanna take procedures, he claim her heart can't take the anaesthesia
It'll send her body into a seizure, that little thing by the hospital bed, it'll stop beepin'
Hey chick, I'm at a loss for words
What do you say at this time, "Remember when I was nine?"
Tell her everything gon' be fine, but I be lyin'
Her family cryin', they want her to live, and she tryin'
I'm arguin like, "What kind of doctor can we fly in?"
You know the best medicine go to people that's paid
If Magic Johnson got a cure for AIDS and all the broke motherfuckers passed away
You telling me if my grandma's in the NBA, right now she'd be okay?
But since she was just a secretary, worked for the church for thirty-five years
Things supposed to stop right here, my grandfather tryin to pull it together, he's strong
That's where I get my confidence from
I asked the nurse, "Did you do the research?"
She asked me, "Can you sign some T-shirts?"
Bitch, is you smokin' reefer?
You don't see that we hurt? But still


I smile when Rosie comes to see me
And I can't wait for a sunny day (Seeing it through your eyes)
Can't wait for the clouds to break


They outside of the emergency room, room, you can feel my heartbeat, beat, beat
If she gon' pull through, we gon' find out soon but right now she asleep, sleep, sleep
My mama say they say she could pass away anyday
Hey chick, what these doctors know anyway?
Let me see the X-rays, I ain't no expert, I'm just hurt
Cousin Kim took off of work
Plus my Aunt Shirley, Aunt Beverly, Aunt Clay, and Aunt Jean
So many aunties we could have an auntie team
Feel like Amerie, it's just one thing when they said that she made it you see they eyes gleam
I think we at a all-time high to get there, we run, we fly, we drive
'Cause with my family we know where home is so instead of sending flowers, we're the roses


I smile when Rosie comes to see me
And I can't wait for a sunny day (Seeing it through your eyes)
Can't wait for the clouds to break
Oh, Rosie brings the sunshine, oh

I smile when roses comes to see me
And I can't wait for a sunny day (Seeing it through your eyes)
Can't wait for the clouds to break


I smile when Rosie come to see me
And I'm sad, when Rosie goes away
Oh Rosie brings the sunshine (Say)


Can't wait, I can't wait, no
Can't wait, I can't wait, no
Can't wait, I, can't wait
No, can't wait, for, for a sunny day
Momma can't wait for the clouds to break
Mm mmm mm mm-mm mm-mm
Oh, oh, oh, oh, no, no, say
Tellin' you the truth now
Said I can't wait, uh-uh
I won't wait, no
I always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down, way down, way down
One day, they'd tried to bring me down
Always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down
Way down, they'd try to bring me down


We gon' to Mass today, we have to pray
Besides what the pastor say, I have to say since Pac passed away
Most you rappers don't even deserve a track from me
You see, if you ever wanted to ever be anything
There'd always be somebody that shoot down any dream
There'll always be haters, that's the way it is
Hater niggas marry hater bitches and have hater kids
But they gon' have to take my life 'fore they take my drive
'Cause when I was barely livin', that's what kept me alive
Just the thought that maybe it could be better than what we at at this time
Make it out of this grind, 'fore I'm out of my mind
And get some leeway on the he say she say
Your girl don't like me, how long has she been gay?
Spanish girls say, "Yo, no hablo ingl√©s"
And everybody want to run to me for their single
It's funny how these wack niggas need my help
Wasn't around when I couldn't feed myself
Dawg, if I was you, I wouldn't feel myself
Dawg, if I was you, I'd kill myself
Made a mil' myself and I'm still myself
And I'mma look in the mirror if I need some help
Now I'll speak from the heart, y'all all frontin'
Everybody feel a way about K but at least y'all feel something


Why'd you come then?
I bet only for getting what some get would get ya
What kinda dream we found?
See I'm often at your crossways
Forgetting where the hell I met ya
And try to bring me down

I always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down, way down, way down
Always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down
Always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down
Way down, they'd try to bring me down
You make me smile in my heart, oh


Why everything that's supposed to be bad make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
Man, I tried to stop man, I tried the best I could
But (You make me smile)


What's your addiction? Is it money? Is it girls? Is it weed?
I've been afflicted by not one, not two, but all three
She's got the same thing, about me, but more, about us
She's coming over, so I guess, that means, I'm her drugs
Just let me peek now, I mean damn, I'm so curious
She's got a lover, so the lies, and the lust, is a rush
Time's of the essence, I need, you to be spontaneous
Roll up the doja, Henny and Coca-Cola
Then I'm co coming over 'cause it's never over


Why everything that's supposed to be bad make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
Man, I tried to stop man, I tried the best I could
But (You make me smile)


I see the emotion in your eyes, that you, try not to show
We get the closest when you high, or you drunk, or you blown
So I pour the potion, so we could both get high, as we could go
Then I'll get the lotion, and do somethin' to me, when your thighs is exposed
There's no turning back now, I mean I don't mean to impose
Not now but right now, I need you to undress, and then pose
I'm into that now, catch a vibe, when the doors, get closed
Roll up the doja, Henny and Coca Cola
And I keep co coming over 'cause it's never over


Why everything that's supposed to be bad make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
Man, I tried to stop man, I tried the best I could
But (You make me smile)


You make me smile
You make me smile with my heart, oh


Why everything that's supposed to be bad make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
Man, I tried to stop man, I tried the best I could
But (You make me smile with my heart)


I just wanted to ask you
Just wanted to um, let me, how would I put this uh
Let's say all your friends, remember the one
You said if you ever she would be the one
OK, OK, OK (You make me smile with my heart, oh)
I was thinking, hypothetically
I mean don't take this seriously
Don't take me, I mean just, uhh, not credibly
I'm feeling incredibly, I mean let it be
I just let it be, I mean you, her and me (You make me smile with my heart, oh)
I mean you, her and me
Maybe, baby, baby
Baby, baby
You know I was just kidding
Unless you gon' do it (You make me smile)
We broke, broke broke phi broke
We ain't got it
Broke, broke, broke phi broke
We ain't got it

Don't spend no money
Ain't got no clothes
Ain't got no cars
Ain't got no hos

We broke, broke, broke phi broke
We ain't got it
Broke, broke, broke phi broke
We ain't got it

Got no money (Got no money)
We got no clothes (Got no clothes)
Ain't got no cars (Got no cars)
Can't get no hos

We broke, broke, broke, broke, broke
Buncha niggas
Broke, broke, broke, broke, broke
Throw your diamonds in the sky
If you feel the vibe

The ROC is still alive
Every time I rhyme

For ever, ever? For ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?

Good Morning, this ain't Vietnam
Still, people lose hands, legs, arms for real
Little was known of Sierra Leone
And how it connect to the diamonds we own
When I speak of diamonds in this song
I ain't talkin' bout the ones that be glowin'
I'm talkin' bout Roc-a-fella, my home, my chain
These ain't conflict diamonds, is they Jacob?
Don't lie to me man
See, a part of me sayin' keep shinin',
How? when I know of the blood diamonds
Though it's thousands of miles away
Sierra Leone connect to what we go through today
Over here, it's a drug trade, we die from drugs
Over there, they die from what we buy from drugs
The diamonds, the chains, the bracelets, the charmses
I thought my Jesus Piece was so harmless
'Til I seen a picture of a shorty armless
And here's the conflict
It's in a black person's soul to rock that gold
Spend ya whole life tryin' to get that ice
On a polo rugby it look so nice
How could somethin' so wrong make me feel so right, right?
'fore I beat myself up like Ike
You could still throw ya Rocafella diamond tonight, 'cause


Throw ya diamonds in the sky
If you feel the vibe

The ROC is still alive
Everytime I rhyme

For ever, ever? For ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?

People askin' me is I'm gon' give my chain back (uh)
That'll be the same day I give the game back (uh)
You know the next question dog 'yo, where Dame at?'(uh)
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back (whoo!)
'wassup wit you a Jay man, are ya'll okay man?'

[Jay-Z]
Yep!
I got it from her 'ye damn!
The chain remains, the game is in tact
The name is mine, I'll take blame for that
The pressure's on, but guess who ain't gon' crack? [laughs]
Pardon me I had to laugh at that
How could you falter when you're the rock of Gibraltar
I had to get of the boat so I could walk on water
This ain't no tall order, this is nothin' to me
Difficult takes a day, impossible takes a week
I do this in my sleep,
I sold Kilos of coke, so?
I'm guessin' I can sell CD's
I'm not a businessman, I'm a business, man
Let me handle my business, damn!
Kanyeez you got me, Freeway and Foxy
YG', Teairra Mari, Petey watch me
Bleek could be one hit away his whole career
As long as I'm alive, he's a millionaire
And even if I die, he's in my will somewhere
So he can just kick back and chill somewhere, oh yeah
He don't even have to write rhymes
The dynasty like my money last 3 lifetimes
Shirley Bassey was in the rear sayin' exactly
What I was sayin' practically me whole career
The diamond is forever, I been minin' this forever
Now the Louis Vuitton Don's timin' couldn't be better
People lined up to see the Titanic sinkin'
Instead we rose from the ash like a phoenix
If you waitin' for the end, the dynasty signed
And what seemed like forever is a mighty long time
I'm young bitches [laughs]
Goodnight!
You motherfuckers better do your job and roll up, and watch how we roll up
And I can't control it, I can't hold it, it's so nuts
I take a sip of that 'gnac, I wanna fuck
I take a hit of that chronic, it got me stuck
But really what's amazin' is how I keep blazin'
Towel under the door, we smoke until the day's end
Puff, puff and pass, don't fuck up rotation
Hpnotiq for Henny? Now nigga that's a chaser
Turn nothin' to somethin', now pimpin' that's a savior
Best things are green now pimpin get your paper
High off the ground from stair to skyscraper
Cool out, thinkin' we local, c'mon homey we major


We major? C'mon homie we major
We major? C'mon homie we major
We major, c'mon homie we major
We major, c'mon

Feelin' better than some head on a Sunday afternoon
Better than a chick that say yes too soon
Until you have a daughter that's what I call karma
And you pray to God she don't grow breasts too soon
Projects to' up, gang signs is thrown up
Niggas hats broke off, that's how we grow up
Why else you think shorties write rhymes just to blow up?
Get they first car and then IRS show up
He ain't never had shit, but he had that nine
Nigga come through flickin' and he had that shine
Put two and two together and a little bad weather
Gon' be your whole family on that funeral line
Asked the reverend was the strip clubs cool
If my tips helped send a pretty girl through school
That's all I want, like winos want they good whiskey
I ain't in the Klan but I brought my hood with me


You motherfuckers better do your job and roll up, and watch how we roll up
And I can't control it, I can't hold it, it's so nuts
I take a sip of that 'gnac, I wanna fuck
I take a hit of that chronic, it got me stuck
But really what's amazin' is how I keep blazin'
Towel under the door, we smoke until the day's end
Puff, puff and pass, don't fuck up rotation
Hpnotiq for Henny? Now nigga that's a chaser
Turn nothin' to somethin', now pimpin' that's a savior
Best things are green now pimpin get your paper
High off the ground from stair to skyscraper
Cool out, thinkin' we local, c'mon homey we major


We major? C'mon homie we major
We major? C'mon homie we major
We major, c'mon homie we major
We major, c'mon homie we major

I heard the beat and I ain't know what to write
First line should it be about the hoes or the ice?
Fo-fo's or Black Christ? Both flows'd be nice
Rap about big paper or the black man plight
At the studio console, asked my man to the right
What this verse sound like, should I freestyle or write?
He said, "Nas what the fans want is Illmatic, Stillmatic"
Looked at the pad and pen, fell, and jotted what I feel
Been like twelve years since a nigga first signed
Now I'm a free agent and I'm thinkin' it's time
To build my very own Motown
'Cause rappers be deprived, of executive nine to five's
And it hurts to see these companies be stealin' the life
And I love to give my blood sweat and tears to the mic
So y'all copped the LP's and y'all fiends got dealt
I'm Jesse Jackson on the balcony when King got killed
I survived the livest niggas around
Last longer than more than half of you clowns
Look, I used to cook before I had the game took
Either way, my change came like Sam Cooke
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah


Feeling better than I ever felt before today
Like better late than never is orientation
Still we can make it better throwing all your cares away


You motherfuckers better do your job and roll up, and watch how we roll up
And I can't control it, I can't hold it, it's so nuts
I take a sip of that 'gnac, I wanna fuck
I take a hit of that chronic, it got me stuck
But really what's amazin' is how I keep blazin'
Towel under the door, we smoke until the day's end
Puff, puff and pass, don't fuck up rotation
Hpnotiq for Henny? Now nigga that's a chaser
Turn nothin' to somethin', now pimpin' that's a savior
Best things are green now pimpin' get your paper
High off the ground from stair to skyscraper
Cool out, thinkin' we local, c'mon homey we major


We major? (C'mon homie we major)
We major? (C'mon homie we major)
We major, (C'mon homie we major)
We major


Feeling better than I ever felt before today
Like better late than never is orientation
Still we can make it better throwing all your cares away


Can I talk my shit again?
Can I talk my shit again?
I can't believe I'm back up in this motherfucker
I'mma be late though
I gotta figure out what I'm finna wear
Yeah, the Roc is definitely in the building
GOOD Music's definitely in the building
I gotta say what's up to Tony Williams
On the vocals sings, he sings quite beautifully
Don't you agree? Don't you agree?
Uh, and Jon Brion on the keys right now
And Warren Campbell on the keys right now
So they ask me, why you call it "Late Registration" Ye?
'Cause we takin' these motherfuckers back to school
If you know this part right here, feel free to sing along


Feeling better than I ever felt before today (If you feelin' good)
But better late than never it's orientation (It's orientation)
Still we can make it better, throwin' all your cares away (We want you to get used to this)


Uh, they can't do what we do baby
Uh-uh, uh-uh, they can't do what we do baby
Uh-uh, uh-uh, they can't do what we do baby
Yeah
This was founded years ago
By broke slaves, years ago
Who did not have, years ago
By broke brothas in the 20s, years ago
Who did not have when we could not eat 
Hmm, remember that?
Eating all of our cereal with forks because we wanted to save the milk, do you remember that? Hmm?
Do you remember all those Christmases when your Mama walked in the room and pretended she was the tree, huh?
Remember that?
Hey Mama, I wanna scream so loud for you, cause I'm so proud of you
And Let me tell you what I'm about to do, Hey Mama
I know I act a fool but I promise you I'm goin' back to school
And I appreciate what you allowed for me
And I just want you to be proud of me.
Hey Mama.

I wanna tell the whole world about a friend of mine
This little light of mine and I'm finna let it shine
I'm finna take ya'll back to them better times
I'm gonna talk about my mama if ya'll don't mind
I was 3 years old, when you and I moved to the Chi
Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold
You fixed me up somethin' that was good for my soul
Famous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl?
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike
And you would give anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn't give me a curl
And you never put no man over me
And I love you for that Mommy can't you see?
7 years old, I caught you with tears in your eyes
Cause a nigga cheatin' tellin' you lies then I started to cry
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said Mommy I'm a love you so you don't hurt no more
And when I'm older, you ain't gotta work no more
And I'm a get you that mansion that we couldn't afford
See your unbreakable unmistakable
Highly capable, lady that's makin loot
A livin' legend too, just look at what heaven do
Send us an angel, and I thank you.

Hey Mama, I wanna scream so loud for you, cause I'm so proud of you
And Let me tell you what I'm about to do, Hey Mama
I know I act a fool but I promise you I'm goin' back to school
And I appreciate what you allowed for me
And I just want you to be proud of me.
Hey Mama.

Forrest Gump mama said, life is like a box of chocolates
My mama told me "Go to school get your doctorate."
Somethin' to fall back on, you could profit with
But still supported me when I did the opposite
Now I feel like it's things I gotta get
Things I gotta do, just to prove to you
You was gettin' through, can the choir please
Give me a verse of "You Are So Beautiful To Me?"
Can't you see, you're like a book of poetry
Maya Angelou, Nicky Jovanni, turn 1 page and there's my Mommy
Come on Mommy just dance with me, let the whole world see your dancing feet
Now when I say "Hey" ya'll say "Mama" now everybody answer me.

Hey Mama, I wanna scream so loud for you, cause I'm so proud of you
And Let me tell you what I'm about to do, Hey Mama
I know I act a fool but I promise you I'm goin' back to school
And I appreciate what you allowed for me
And I just want you to be proud of me.
Hey Mama.

I guess it also depends though, if my ends low
Second they get up you gon' get that Benzo
Tint the windows, ride around the city and let your friends know.
Hey Mama.

Tell your job you gotta fake 'em out
Since you brought me in this world, let me take you out
To a restaurant, upper echelon
I'm a get you a jag, whatever else you want
Just tell me what kind of S-Type Donda West like?
Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right
It don't gotta be Mother's Day, or your birthday
For me to just call and say "Hey Mama."

I wanna scream so loud for you, cause I'm so proud of you
And Let me tell you what I'm about to do, Hey Mama.
You know I love you so and I never let you go
I wrote this song just so you know no matter where you go my love is true.
Hey Mama.
Hey Mama.
Hey Mama.
Hey Mama.
Hey Mama.

My mama mama mama.
My mama mama mama.
My mama mama mama.
My mama mama mama.
My mama mama mama.
My mama mama mama.
My mama mama mama.
My mama mama mama.
My mama mama mama.
My mama mama mama.
My mama mama mama.
My mama mama mama.
My mama mama mama.
My mama mama mama.
My mama mama mama.
My mama mama mama.
Yeah, you know what this is
It's a celebration, bitches!
Grab a drink, grab a glass
After that I grab your ass.

Why you actin' all
Shy and all
Why is y'all
Lyin' for?
"I never did this before..."
Stop that
What you want some petron?
I got that.
I mean I promise y'all
You fine and all
And your girlfriend, she kinda raw
But she not like you
No, she not like you
Right now I need you to mute all the monologue
All that talkin' is gon' give me a tylenol
You put a nigga to sleep, I'm tired of ya'll
Right now the Louis Vuitton Don is signing off
But I just thought we should know
We hit the liquor store
Got some Cris and some Mo
And we about to let it flow
Had some problems before but see we let 'em go
Got an ounce of that dro
And we about to let it blow.

Yeah, you know what this is
It's a celebration, bitches!
Grab a drink, grab a glass
After that, I grab your ass.

See you know my style
I'm very wild
And I vow that my child will be well endowed
Like his daddy
And tell him that you had a phatty
He looked up at me said "Daddy that's the reason why you had me?"
Yep, we was praticing
'Til one day your ass bust through the packaging
You know what though? You my favorite accident
So go head pop some Cristal
For my newborn child cause now y'all...

Know what this is
It's a celebration, bitches!
Grab a drink, grab a glass
After that I grab your ass.
But I just thought we should know
We hit the liquor store
Got some Cris and some Mo
And we about to let it flow
Had some problems before but see we let 'em go
Got an ounce of that dro
And we about to let it blow.

Hoe! Hoe! 
We lookin' for some
Hoe! Hoe! Hoe!
[Quietly]
Broke, broke, broke phi broke (we ain't got it)
Broke, broke, broke phi broke (we ain't got it)
[Louder]
Broke, broke broke phi broke (we ain't got it)
Broke, broke, broke phi- 

[Leader:] I've called this private meeting today because there is an imposter among us.
There is an imposter among us.
This brother right here has been out making beats on the side, yes he has.
Pretending he's broke walking amongst us.
This brother has been eating every day, can you believe that? Eating every day.
Pretending he's with us, he's not one of us.
I did not want to believe this, but I walked into the brother Kanye's closet and I found new shoes.
I found new shoes!
Kanye, would you like to step forward and explain these new shoes?!

[Kanye: (stammering)] I was-you crazy, I wasn't, I didn't, um, I was just um, I was-

[Leader:] No, you speak up, brother!

[Kanye:] I was gon' stick-I'm tryin to stick to my roots and-

[Leader:] What?

[Kanye:] I wanna stick to my roots, and-

[Leader:] What?! You march your new shoes out of here, Kanye.
Don't you ever come back in 'em. Don't you ever come back smellin' all good, taking showers and shit like
That, all right? We don't appreciate that down here at Broke Phi Broke.

What's next?
Wished I had told
Ooh was the only one (Uh oh)
But it's too late
It's too late, he's gone


You sweat her and I ain't talkin 'bout a Coogi
You a Big L and I ain't talkin 'bout Cool J
See me at the airport, at least twenty Louis
Treat me like the Prince and this my sweet brother Numpsay
(Brother Numpsay) Groupies say I'm too choosy
Take em to the show and talk all through the movies
Says she want diamonds, I took her to Ruby Tuesdays
If we up in Fridays, I still have it my way


(Gone) We striving home
(Gone) (I ride on chrome), it's too late


Y'all don't want no prob' from me
What you rappers could get is a job from me
Maybe you could be my intern
And in turn, I'll show you how I cook up summer in the winter
Aaron love the raw dog, when will he learn?
Caught something on the Usher tour, he had to let it burn
Plus he already got three children
Arguin' over babysitters like, "Bitch it's yo' turn"
"Damn Ye it'd be stupid to diss you
Even your superficial raps is super-official"
Roc pastel with Gucci on
With TV's in the ride, throw a movie on
Said he couldn't rap, now he at the top with Doobie Long
'Cause I dookied on any song that they threw me on, gone


We striving home, gone
(I ride on chrome), gone
We striving home, gone
(Killa, I ride on chrome)

Knock knock, who's there? Killa Cam, Killa who?
Killa Cam, hustler, grinder, guerilla true
Oh my chinchilla blue, blue you ever dealt with a dealer
Well here's the deal, ma we going to the dealer, woo
No concealing, no ceiling I don't need a roof
Act up, get out, I don't need you poof
Poof be gone, damn tough luck dag
Dag, niggas still doing puff-puff-pass
Pull the truck up fast and I tell em
Hey back in a touched up Jag shit
Y'all niggas wanna get in Cam's cerebellum
An old man just gon' tell em, "Too late, he's gone"
Then I see how y'all gonna react when I'm gone
My last girl want me back then I'm on
Fine stay, you got the grind hey
Came back, read what the sign say, "Too late, he's gone)
Yes I know you wanna see my demise
Yeah you church boy, acting like a thief in disguise
Ain‚Äôt even my size, see the greed in my eyes
Ask Abby, I hustle, brought weed to the Chi, shit
And that ain't even a lie, please believe me
Gave Weezie a piece of the pie and
You can ask George or Regina
The whole West Side I explore with the Bimmer now

We striving home
I ride on chrome
Listen, homeboy, move on
That's your best bet, why's that, Cons?


I been pouring out some liquor for the fact that my pal's gone
And trying to help his mama with the fact that her child gone
And since we used to bubble like a tub full of Calgon
Guess it's only right that I should help her from now on
But since they got afoul on, what could've gone wrong?
Now they asking Cons, "How long has this gone on?"
And maybe all this money might have gone to my head
'Cause they got me thinking money might have gone to the Feds
So I had gone to the dread, but he had gone up to bed
And when I came the next morning he was gone with my bread
And with that being said I had gone on my instincts
And gone to the spots where they go to get mixed drinks
But looking back now, I should've gone to the crib
And rented  'cause I'd a-gone in by ten
But I had gone with my friend, and we had gone to the bar
And heard a nigga talking shit so I had gone to the car
And now the judge is telling me that I had gone too far
And now we gone for twenty years doing time behind bars
And since I gone to a cell for some petty crimes
I guess I gone to the well one too many times 'cause I'm gone


I'm ahead of my time, sometimes years out
So the powers that be won't let me get my ideas out
And that make me wanna get my advance out
And move to Oklahoma and just live at my aunt's house
Yeah, I romance the thought of leaving it all behind
Kanye step away from the lime
Light like when I was on the grind in the 1999
Before model chicks was bending over
Or dealerships asked me, "Benz or Rover"
Man, if I could just get one beat on Hova
We could get up off this cheap-ass sofa
What the summer of the Chi got to offer an eighteen-year-old
Sell drugs or get a job, you gotta play your role
My dog worked at Taco Bell, hooked us up plural
Fired a week later, the manager count the churros
Sometimes I can't believe it when I look up in the mirro'
How we out in Europe, spending Euros
They claim you never know what you got till it's gone
I know I got it, I don't know what y'all on
I'mma open up a store for aspiring emcees
Won't sell 'em no dream, but the inspiration is free
But if they ever flip sides like Anakin
You'll sell everything including the mannequin
They got a new bitch, now you Jennifer Aniston
Hold on, I'll handle it, don't start panickin', stay calm
Shorties at the door 'cause they need more
Inspiration for they life, they souls, and they songs
They said, "Sorry, Mr. West is gone"
Diamonds are forever
They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might
Desert me

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme.
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?......

Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic
Vegas on acid,
Seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses
And I've realized that I've arrived, cuz
It take more than a magazine to kill my Vibrate does
he write his own rhymes, so sort of
I think 'em
That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought up
Damn, is he really that caught up?
I ask if you talkin' bout classics, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort or even a four-track recorder
so its only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
- its for yourself that's important
If you're a stripper named Porscha and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend her nickname is Minivan
Excuse me,
That's just the Henny, man, I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop I can't because

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme.
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?......

I was sick about awards
Couldn't nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense to them
30 minutes later seems there's no convincing them
What more could you ask for?
The international asshole
Who complains about what he is owed?
And throw a tantrum like he is three years old
You gotta love it though somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldn't change by the change, or the game, or the fame, 
When he came, in the game, he made his own lane
Now all I need is y'all to pronounce my name
Its Kanye - But some of my plaques - they still say Kane
Got family in the D, Kin-folk from Motown
Back in the Chi - them folks ain't from Motown
Life movin' too fast I need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, ya need to go down

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
My father Ben said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my ceaser
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then my body got still like a paraplegic

You know who you can call you gotta best believe it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic
Yea the beat cold but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit, it sound like the best of
A&R's lookin' like "Pssh we messed up"
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle 'till we got messed up
In the studio, where really though, yea he next up
People askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question dog "Yo, where Dame at?"
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
"What's up with you and Jay, man, are y'all ok man?"
They pray for the death of our dynasty like Amen
R-r-r-right here stands a-man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands...

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme.
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?......

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
Little girl, please stop your crying
'Cause I'll be late for that


I'll be late for that, baby I'll wait for that
If you had a taste of that, you'd probably pay for that
I'm comin' in when I feel like
So turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right

I'll be late for that, I can't wait for that
I think I was made for that
So I'm comin' in when I feel like
So turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right


Little girl, please stop your crying
'Cause I'll be late for that


Stop all your blood clot cryin', I was flyin'
Made it to school with barely enough time to sign in
Yeah, I hear the alarm, yeah, I hear ya mom
Yeah yeah, I don't want be broke when I'm thirty-one
They said the best classes go to the fastest
Sorry Mr. West, there's no good classes and that's what yo' ass get
Not even electives? Not even pre-requits?
You mean I missed my major by a couple of seconds?
Now I'm in the shop class or the basket weavin'
With all the rest of the motherfuckers underachievin'
Man, this is a insult
I went to junior high with all of them and they been slow
If I can catch the beat then slow down the tempo
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Will I make it from the student loans to a Benzo?
Like old folks pissin', I guess it all depends, oh, oh


Little girl, please stop your crying (Stop your cryin' baby)
'Cause I'll be late for that


I'll be late for that, baby I'll wait for that
If you had a taste of that, you'd probably pay for that
I'm comin' in when I feel like
So turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right

I'll be late for that, I can't wait for that
I think I was made for that
So I'm comin' in when I feel like
So turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right


Little girl, please stop your crying
'Cause I'll be late for that


You know when you be late, you miss all the lights
That's right, that's right, that's right, that's right
And when you get back she gon' start up a fight
That night, that night, that night
Baby it's too late for that, lately I've been takin' it slow
Try and make it to the party 'fore the guest list close
With the freshest hoes, the professors know
We about to get real unprofessional
Like them eskimos, what would you do for a Klondike?
Or two dykes that look Christina Milian-like
Hm, I'll be on time for that
I ain't thought of no line that could rhyme with that
Yo, I'll be there in five minutes
Five hours later, I'll be there in five minutes, go 'head ride with it
I'm so live with it, look how I did it
Been bullshittin' but I finally arrived with it
I know it's late and I took all year but
You can stop complainin' 'cause I'm finally here, yeah


'Cause I'll be late for that
I'll be late for that
I'll be late for that
I'll be late for that
[Kanye West]
("Make It Up") We can make it better
("Make It Up") We can make it better
("Make It Up") We can make it better
("Make It Up") We can make it

Somebody told me that Delta's brownskinned, AKAs' lightskinned
And they supposed to be bougious, so they got white friends
First day of school, I'mma take you sight seein'
Show you what we do on weekends for excitement
She said, "I know what you about to say, like your hypeman"
She let a nigga hit it, and now she only date white men
And if a nigga even wave at her, it's frightnin'; but

[Chorus: Kanye West]
("Make It Up") We can make it better
(Better we can)
("Make It Up") We can make it better
(Better we can bring it on up, we can)
("Make It Up") We can make it better
(Better we can)
("Make It Up") We can make it

[Talib Kweli]
The night fallin' over Brooklyn, where they murder for change
The converter remains faithful to the drugdealer priestess
He in search of the word of fame, you heard of the name
Kweli the truth, like I'm comin' out the mouth of babes
One for it, one for out the grave
Niggaz want they reperations, How you calculate the amount to be paid
You try to imagine America without the slaves (the slaves)

[Chorus]

[Q-Tip]
Her tenament yo, is rat infested
Her heart is like a gold bouillon cause she wouldn't protest it
Cause, her bestfriend's man got popped
He was sixteen years old, the cop thought his phone was a glock
In the hood is a everday happenin'
A friend of the priest say she chewed out the captain
She yelled out "Why you do this to black men?"

[Chorus]

[Common]
I think of eighty seven ways, to make better days
Whether climb or rhyme, I heard of rebel pays
On the scene, tryin' to get green like everglades
Music, rhymin' good like escalates
In the ghetto infested by shade and drama
And niggaz wit' thangs ain't afraid of karma
I'm thinkin' big like Little Wayne in the (?)

[Chorus]

[Rhymefest]
C'mon; Tell people the truth, but never give 'em ya true thoughts
Terrorism on blacks, they poison our Newports
Partiot Act in effect, make it hard to breathe now
Johnny Cochran dead, who gonna get us free now?
Clinton ain't in office, who gon' give us shit free now?
Who gon' make it better for the thugs and Ps now?
Who gon' make it good for old folks that's senile?
Oh, it's good music, yeah dog I see now

[Chorus]
Diamonds are forever
They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might
Desert me

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme.
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?......

Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic

so its only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
- its for yourself that's important
If you're a stripper named Porscha and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend her nickname is Minivan
Excuse me,
That's just the Henny, man, I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop I can't because

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme.
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?......

I was sick about awards
Couldn't nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense to them
30 minutes later seems there's no convincing them
What more could you ask for?
The international asshole
Who complains about what he is owed?
And throw a tantrum like he is three years old
You gotta love it though somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldn't change by the change, or the game, or the fame, 
When he came, in the game, he made his own lane
Now all I need is y'all to pronounce my name
Its Kanye - But some of my plaques - they still say Kane
Got family in the D, Kin-folk from Motown
Back in the Chi - them folks ain't from Motown
Life movin' too fast I need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, ya need to go down

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
My father Ben said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my ceaser
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then my body got still like a paraplegic

You know who you can call you gotta best believe it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic
Yea the beat cold but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit, it sound like the best of
A&R's lookin' like "Pssh we messed up"
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle 'till we got messed up
In the studio, where really though, yea he next up
People askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question dog "Yo, where Dame at?"
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
"What's up with you and Jay, man, are y'all ok man?"
They pray for the death of our dynasty like Amen
R-r-r-right here stands a-man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands...

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme.
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?......

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
I gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'mma touch the sky
Gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'mma touch the sky

Back when they thought pink Polos would hurt the Roc
Before Cam got the shit to pop, the doors was closed
I felt like Bad Boy's street team, I couldn't work the LOX
Now let's go, take 'em back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in that U-Haul van
Any pessimists I ain't talk to them
Plus I ain't have no phone in my apart-a-ment
Let's take 'em back to the club
Least about an hour I stand on line, I just wanted to dance
I went to Jacob an hour after I got my advance, I just wanted to shine
Jay favorite line, "Dawg, in due time"
Now he look at me, like, "Damn, dawg, you where I am"
A hip hop legend, I think I died
In that accident, 'cause this must be heaven

I gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'm a touch the sky
Gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'mma touch the sky

Now let's take 'em high-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh la la la la la la la
(Top of the world, baby, top top of the world)
(Top of the world, baby, on top of the world)
Now let's take 'em high-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh la la la la la la la
(Top of the world, baby, top top of the world)
(Top of the world, baby, on top of the world) Uh

Back when Gucci was the shit to rock
Back when Slick Rick got the shit to pop
I'd do anything to say I got it
Damn, them new loafers hurt my pocket
Before anybody wanted K. West beats, me and my girl split the buffet at KFC
Dog, I was having nervous breakdowns like, "Man, these niggas that much better than me?"
Baby, I'm going on an aeroplane and I don't know if I'll be back again
Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets but when she came to kick it, things became different
Any girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on
Couldn't keep it at home, thought I needed a Nia Long
I'm trying to right my wrongs but it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song, now

I gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gonna touch the sky
You gonna touch the sky baby girl
Testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gonna touch the sky


Yes, yes, yes
Guess who's on third?
Lupe steal like Lupin the 3rd
Here like ear till I'm beer on the curb
Peach fuzz buzz but beard on the verge
Let's slow it down like we're on the syrup
Bottle shaped body like Mrs. Butterworth
But, before you say another word
I'm back on the block like I'm laying on the street
I'm trying to stop lion like I'm Mumm-Ra
But I'm not lyin' when I'm laying on the beat
En garde, or touch√©, Lupe cool as the unthawed
But I still feel possessed as a gun charge
Come as correct as a porn star
In a fresh pair steps in my best foreign car
So, I represent the first
Now let me end my verse right where the horns are like uh


I gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gonna touch the sky
You gonna touch the sky baby girl
Testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gonna touch the sky

We back at home, baby
Sky high
I'm, I'm sky high
I'm, I'm sky high
I'm, I'm sky high
I'm, I'm sky high
I'm, I'm sky high
Sky, uh, sky high
I'm, I'm sky high

Yeah
Keep it rollin'
Yeah
Uh, feels good to be home, baby
Feels good to be home
That's that crack music nigga
That real black music nigga

(That's that crack music nigga
That real black music nigga)


How we stop the Black Panthers?
Ronald Reagan cooked up an answer
You hear that? What Gil Scott was hearing
When our heroes or heroines got hooked on heroin
Crack raised the murder rate in D.C. and Maryland
We invested in that, it's like we got Merrill lynched
And we been hangin' from the same tree ever since
Sometimes I feel the music is the only medicine
So we, cook it, cut it, measure it, bag it sell it
The fiends cop it, nowadays they can't tell if
That's that good shit, we ain't sure man
Put the CD on your tongue, yeah that's pure man


That's that crack music nigga
That real black music nigga

(That's that crack music nigga
That real black music nigga)


From the place where the father's gone, the mothers is hardly home
And the madigon's lock us up in the Audy Home
How the Mexicans say, we just tryin' to party holmes
They wanna pack us all in a box like styrofoam
Who gave Saddam anthrax?
George Bush got the answers
Back in the hood, it's a different type of chemical
Arm & Hammer baking soda raised they own quota
Right when our soldiers, ran for the stove 'cause
'Cause, dreams of being Hova
Went from bein' a broke man to bein' a dopeman
To bein' the President, look there's hope man
This that inspiration for the Moes and the Folks man
Shorty come and see his momma straight overdosin'
And this is the soundtrack
This the type of music that you make when you 'round that


Crack music nigga
That real black music nigga

(That's that crack music nigga
That real black music nigga)


God, how could you let this happen?
Happen, happen
Happen, happen
Happen


Uh, that's that crack music, crack music
That real black music, black music

(That's that crack music nigga
That real black music nigga)


That's that crack music, crack music
That real black music, black music


Our Father, give us this day, our daily bread
Before the feds give us these days and take our daily bread
See I done did all this ol' bullshit
And to atone, I throw a little somethin' somethin' on the pulpit
We took that shit, measured it and then cooked that shit
And what we gave back was crack music
And now we ooze it through they nooks and crannies
So our mamas ain't got to be they cooks and nannies
And we gon' repo everything they ever took from granny
Now the former slaves trade hooks for Grammys
This dark diction has become America's addiction
Those who ain't even black use it
We gon' keep baggin' up this here crack music
Drive slow, homie
Drive slow, homie
You never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie

My homie Marley used to stay 79th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street from Calumet, a school for the Stones
He nicknamed me K-Rock so they would leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
And walked around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand
Keys in his hand, reason again to let you know he's the man
Back when we rocked Ellesses, he had dreams of Caprices
Drove by the teachers, even more by polices
How'd he get the cash? The day his father passed away
Left him with a little somethin, sixteen he was stuntin'
Al B. Sure nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit Lake Shore, girls go all crazy
Hit the freeway, go at least 'bout eighty
Boned so much that summer, even had him a baby
See back-back then-then, if you had a car
You was the Chi-Town version of Baby
And I was just a virgin, a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
We'd take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had they Lincolns and Auroras, we was hurtin 'em all
With the girls a lot of flirtin' involved, but dog
Fuck all that flirtin', I'm tryin' to get in some drawers
So put me on with these hoes, homie
He told me don't rush to get grown, drive slow, homie

Drive slow, homie
Drive slow
You never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie


What it do? I'm posted up in the parking lot, my trunk waving
The candy gloss is immaculate, it's simply amazing
Them elbows pokin' wide on that candy 'Lac
Trunk open, screens on, neons lit with fifth relaxed
I'm on a mission for dime-pieces and sexy ladies
Allow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes
It's a star-studded event when I valet park
Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark
You see them fours crawling? You see them screens falling?
The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin'
I'm leaning on the switch, sitting crooked in my slab
But I could still catch boppers if I drove a cab
A young Houston hard hitter all about the scrilla
Ridin' something candy coated, crawling like a caterpillar
I'm tipping on them fours, I'm jamming on that Screw
I'm looking for them hoes, baby, what it do? Drive slow, homie


Turn your hazard lights of when you see them hoes (Drive slow, homie)
If you're riding around the city with nowhere to go (Drive slow, homie)
Live today, 'cause tomorrow, man, you never know
(You never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie)

(My car's like the movie, my car's like the crib
I got more TVs in here than where I live)
And that don't make no sense, but baby, I'm the shit
And everything I flip, you know it's something serious
I got the custom grill, I got the Brabus rims
I got the baller genetics, baby, this evidence
You see a player flicking, and how you ain't convinced
That you should go on and kiss it, just a little bit (Just a little bit)
I got my custom kicks, I got my Jesus chain
My canaries is gleamin' through my angel wings
They see me, hoes actin like they seen a king
With that mean lean, smoking on that finest Cali green
My woodgrain oak, I'm ridin on Vogues
My cylinder quiet, like tip-toes
I sold O's, and this I know
When you see them hoes, little homie, drive slow


Yeah, drive slow, homie
Drive slow, homie
You never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie
Drive slow, homie
Mr. West
Mr. West
Mr. West


Uh, yeah
Uh, yeah
Uh, yeah
Uh, yeah

And I heard 'em say
"Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today"
From the Chi, like Tim it's a harder way
So this is in the name of love like Robert say
Before you ask me to go get a job today
Can I at least get a raise of the minimum wage?
And I know that the government administer AIDS
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
Allahu Akbar and throw him some hot cars
Things we see on the screen that's not ours
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far
Where I'm from the dope boys is the rock stars
But they can't cop cars without seeing cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars, I know it


Uh, and I heard 'em say
"Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today"
And I heard 'em say
"Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today"
But we'll a find a way
(And nothing last forever but be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way)


They say people in your life are seasons
And anything that happen is for a reason
And niggas gun clapping and keep to squeezing
And gram keep praying and keep believing
In Jesus, and one day that you see him
Till they walk in his footsteps and try to be him
The devil is alive I feel him breathin'
Claiming money is the key, so keep on dreamin'
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us
My Aunt Pam can't put them cigarettes down
So now my little cousin smokin' them cigarettes now
His job try to claim that he too niggerish now
Is it 'cause his skin blacker than licorice now?
I can't figure it out, I'm sick of it now


Uh, and I heard 'em say
"Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today"
And I heard 'em say
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
But we'll a find a way
(And nothing last forever but be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way)


With every worthless word, we get more far away
And nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
And nothing last forever but be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way
I always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down, way down, way down
One day, they'd tried to bring me down
Always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down
Way down, they'd try to bring me down


We gon' to Mass today, we have to pray
Besides what the pastor say, I have to say since Pac passed away
Most you rappers don't even deserve a track from me
You see, if you ever wanted to ever be anything
There'd always be somebody that shoot down any dream
There'll always be haters, that's the way it is
Hater niggas marry hater bitches and have hater kids
But they gon' have to take my life 'fore they take my drive
'Cause when I was barely livin', that's what kept me alive
Just the thought that maybe it could be better than what we at at this time
Make it out of this grind, 'fore I'm out of my mind
And get some leeway on the he say she say
Your girl don't like me, how long has she been gay?
Spanish girls say, "Yo, no hablo ingl√©s"
And everybody want to run to me for their single
It's funny how these wack niggas need my help
Wasn't around when I couldn't feed myself
Dawg, if I was you, I wouldn't feel myself
Dawg, if I was you, I'd kill myself
Made a mil' myself and I'm still myself
And I'mma look in the mirror if I need some help
Now I'll speak from the heart, y'all all frontin'
Everybody feel a way about K but at least y'all feel something


Why'd you come then?
I bet only for getting what some get would get ya
What kinda dream we found?
See I'm often at your crossways
Forgetting where the hell I met ya
And try to bring me down

I always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down, way down, way down
Always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down
Always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down
Way down, they'd try to bring me down
Wished I had told
Ooh was the only one (Uh oh)
But it's too late
It's too late, he's gone


You sweat her and I ain't talkin 'bout a Coogi
You a Big L and I ain't talkin 'bout Cool J
See me at the airport, at least twenty Louis
Treat me like the Prince and this my sweet brother Numpsay
(Brother Numpsay) Groupies say I'm too choosy
Take em to the show and talk all through the movies
Says she want diamonds, I took her to Ruby Tuesdays
If we up in Fridays, I still have it my way


(Gone) We striving home
(Gone) (I ride on chrome), it's too late


Y'all don't want no prob' from me
What you rappers could get is a job from me
Maybe you could be my intern
And in turn, I'll show you how I cook up summer in the winter
Aaron love the raw dog, when will he learn?
Caught something on the Usher tour, he had to let it burn
Plus he already got three children
Arguin' over babysitters like, "Bitch it's yo' turn"
"Damn Ye it'd be stupid to diss you
Even your superficial raps is super-official"
Roc pastel with Gucci on
With TV's in the ride, throw a movie on
Said he couldn't rap, now he at the top with Doobie Long
'Cause I dookied on any song that they threw me on, gone


We striving home, gone
(I ride on chrome), gone
We striving home, gone
(Killa, I ride on chrome)

Knock knock, who's there? Killa Cam, Killa who?
Killa Cam, hustler, grinder, guerilla true
Oh my chinchilla blue, blue you ever dealt with a dealer
Well here's the deal, ma we going to the dealer, woo
No concealing, no ceiling I don't need a roof
Act up, get out, I don't need you poof
Poof be gone, damn tough luck dag
Dag, niggas still doing puff-puff-pass
Pull the truck up fast and I tell em
Hey back in a touched up Jag shit
Y'all niggas wanna get in Cam's cerebellum
An old man just gon' tell em, "Too late, he's gone"
Then I see how y'all gonna react when I'm gone
My last girl want me back then I'm on
Fine stay, you got the grind hey
Came back, read what the sign say, "Too late, he's gone)
Yes I know you wanna see my demise
Yeah you church boy, acting like a thief in disguise
Ain‚Äôt even my size, see the greed in my eyes
Ask Abby, I hustle, brought weed to the Chi, shit
And that ain't even a lie, please believe me
Gave Weezie a piece of the pie and
You can ask George or Regina
The whole West Side I explore with the Bimmer now

We striving home
I ride on chrome
Listen, homeboy, move on
That's your best bet, why's that, Cons?


I been pouring out some liquor for the fact that my pal's gone
And trying to help his mama with the fact that her child gone
And since we used to bubble like a tub full of Calgon
Guess it's only right that I should help her from now on
But since they got afoul on, what could've gone wrong?
Now they asking Cons, "How long has this gone on?"
And maybe all this money might have gone to my head
'Cause they got me thinking money might have gone to the Feds
So I had gone to the dread, but he had gone up to bed
And when I came the next morning he was gone with my bread
And with that being said I had gone on my instincts
And gone to the spots where they go to get mixed drinks
But looking back now, I should've gone to the crib
And rented  'cause I'd a-gone in by ten
But I had gone with my friend, and we had gone to the bar
And heard a nigga talking shit so I had gone to the car
And now the judge is telling me that I had gone too far
And now we gone for twenty years doing time behind bars
And since I gone to a cell for some petty crimes
I guess I gone to the well one too many times 'cause I'm gone


I'm ahead of my time, sometimes years out
So the powers that be won't let me get my ideas out
And that make me wanna get my advance out
And move to Oklahoma and just live at my aunt's house
Yeah, I romance the thought of leaving it all behind
Kanye step away from the lime
Light like when I was on the grind in the 1999
Before model chicks was bending over
Or dealerships asked me, "Benz or Rover"
Man, if I could just get one beat on Hova
We could get up off this cheap-ass sofa
What the summer of the Chi got to offer an eighteen-year-old
Sell drugs or get a job, you gotta play your role
My dog worked at Taco Bell, hooked us up plural
Fired a week later, the manager count the churros
Sometimes I can't believe it when I look up in the mirro'
How we out in Europe, spending Euros
They claim you never know what you got till it's gone
I know I got it, I don't know what y'all on
I'mma open up a store for aspiring emcees
Won't sell 'em no dream, but the inspiration is free
But if they ever flip sides like Anakin
You'll sell everything including the mannequin
They got a new bitch, now you Jennifer Aniston
Hold on, I'll handle it, don't start panickin', stay calm
Shorties at the door 'cause they need more
Inspiration for they life, they souls, and they songs
They said, "Sorry, Mr. West is gone"
Little girl, please stop your crying
'Cause I'll be late for that


I'll be late for that, baby I'll wait for that
If you had a taste of that, you'd probably pay for that
I'm comin' in when I feel like
So turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right

I'll be late for that, I can't wait for that
I think I was made for that
So I'm comin' in when I feel like
So turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right


Little girl, please stop your crying
'Cause I'll be late for that


Stop all your blood clot cryin', I was flyin'
Made it to school with barely enough time to sign in
Yeah, I hear the alarm, yeah, I hear ya mom
Yeah yeah, I don't want be broke when I'm thirty-one
They said the best classes go to the fastest
Sorry Mr. West, there's no good classes and that's what yo' ass get
Not even electives? Not even pre-requits?
You mean I missed my major by a couple of seconds?
Now I'm in the shop class or the basket weavin'
With all the rest of the motherfuckers underachievin'
Man, this is a insult
I went to junior high with all of them and they been slow
If I can catch the beat then slow down the tempo
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Will I make it from the student loans to a Benzo?
Like old folks pissin', I guess it all depends, oh, oh


Little girl, please stop your crying (Stop your cryin' baby)
'Cause I'll be late for that


I'll be late for that, baby I'll wait for that
If you had a taste of that, you'd probably pay for that
I'm comin' in when I feel like
So turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right

I'll be late for that, I can't wait for that
I think I was made for that
So I'm comin' in when I feel like
So turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right


Little girl, please stop your crying
'Cause I'll be late for that


You know when you be late, you miss all the lights
That's right, that's right, that's right, that's right
And when you get back she gon' start up a fight
That night, that night, that night
Baby it's too late for that, lately I've been takin' it slow
Try and make it to the party 'fore the guest list close
With the freshest hoes, the professors know
We about to get real unprofessional
Like them eskimos, what would you do for a Klondike?
Or two dykes that look Christina Milian-like
Hm, I'll be on time for that
I ain't thought of no line that could rhyme with that
Yo, I'll be there in five minutes
Five hours later, I'll be there in five minutes, go 'head ride with it
I'm so live with it, look how I did it
Been bullshittin' but I finally arrived with it
I know it's late and I took all year but
You can stop complainin' 'cause I'm finally here, yeah


'Cause I'll be late for that
I'll be late for that
I'll be late for that
I'll be late for that
She take my money when I'm in need

Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said, I can tell you rock, I can tell by your charm
Far as girls you got a flock, I can tell by your charm

And your arm, but I'm lookin' for the one. Have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have an ass like Serena
Trina, Jeena-fah Lopez, four kids
And I gotta take all they bad ass to ShowBiz

Okay, get your kids, but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to din and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl then you better be paid

You know why? It take too much to touch her
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
My best friend said she used to fuck with Usher
I don't care what none of y'all say, I still love her


Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger, uh

But she ain't messin' wit' no broke niggas, uh

His baby mama car and crib is bigger than his

You will see him on TV, any given Sunday
Win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money
She went to the doctor got lipo with your money

She walkin' around lookin' like Michael with your money
Should've got that insured, GEICO for your money 
If you ain't no punk
Holla we want prenup (We want prenup!)

You don't want a dude to smoke but he can't buy weed
You got out to eat and he can't pay, y'all can't leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves

But while y'all washin', watch him
He gon' make it into a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition, baby, look at his eyes
This week he moppin' floors, next week it's the fries

Gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'mma touch the sky

Back when they thought pink Polos would hurt the Roc
Before Cam got the shit to pop, the doors was closed
I felt like Bad Boy's street team, I couldn't work the LOX
Now let's go, take 'em back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in that U-Haul van
Any pessimists I ain't talk to them
Plus I ain't have no phone in my apart-a-ment
Let's take 'em back to the club
Least about an hour I stand on line, I just wanted to dance
I went to Jacob an hour after I got my advance, I just wanted to shine
Jay favorite line, "Dawg, in due time"
Now he look at me, like, "Damn, dawg, you where I am"
A hip hop legend, I think I died
In that accident, 'cause this must be heaven

I gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'm a touch the sky
Gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'mma touch the sky

Now let's take 'em high-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh la la la la la la la
(Top of the world, baby, top top of the world)
(Top of the world, baby, on top of the world)
Now let's take 'em high-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh la la la la la la la
(Top of the world, baby, top top of the world)
(Top of the world, baby, on top of the world) Uh

Back when Gucci was the shit to rock
Back when Slick Rick got the shit to pop
I'd do anything to say I got it
Damn, them new loafers hurt my pocket
Before anybody wanted K. West beats, me and my girl split the buffet at KFC
Dog, I was having nervous breakdowns like, "Man, these niggas that much better than me?"
Baby, I'm going on an aeroplane and I don't know if I'll be back again
Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets but when she came to kick it, things became different
Any girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on
Couldn't keep it at home, thought I needed a Nia Long
I'm trying to right my wrongs but it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song, now

I gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gonna touch the sky
You gonna touch the sky baby girl
Testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gonna touch the sky


Yes, yes, yes
Guess who's on third?
Lupe steal like Lupin the 3rd
Here like ear till I'm beer on the curb
Peach fuzz buzz but beard on the verge
Let's slow it down like we're on the syrup
Bottle shaped body like Mrs. Butterworth
But, before you say another word
I'm back on the block like I'm laying on the street
I'm trying to stop lion like I'm Mumm-Ra
But I'm not lyin' when I'm laying on the beat
En garde, or touch√©, Lupe cool as the unthawed
But I still feel possessed as a gun charge
Come as correct as a porn star
In a fresh pair steps in my best foreign car
So, I represent the first
Now let me end my verse right where the horns are like uh


I gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gonna touch the sky
You gonna touch the sky baby girl
Testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gonna touch the sky

We back at home, baby
Sky high
I'm, I'm sky high
I'm, I'm sky high
I'm, I'm sky high
I'm, I'm sky high
I'm, I'm sky high
Sky, uh, sky high
I'm, I'm sky high

Yeah
Keep it rollin'
Yeah
Uh, feels good to be home, baby
Feels good to be home
