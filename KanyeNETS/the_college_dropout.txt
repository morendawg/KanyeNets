Kanye, can I talk to you for a minute?
Me and the other faculty members was wonderin', could you do a little som', somethin' beautiful?
Somethin' that the kids is gon' love when they hear it
That's gon' make them start jumpin' up and down and sharin' candy and stuff
Think you could probably do somethin' for the kids for graduation to sing?
Oh yeah, I've got the perfect song for the kids to sing
And all my people that's

Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack ya' money till it get sky high
We wasn't s'posed to make it past twenty-five
Joke's on you, we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
"We don't care what people say"

If this is your first time hearin' this
You are about to experience somethin' so cold, man
We never had nothin' handed, took nothin' for granted
Took nothin' from no man, man, I'm my own man
But as a shorty I looked up to the dopeman
Only adult man I knew that wasn't broke, man
Flickin' Starter coats, man
Man, you don't know, man
We don't care what people say
This is for my niggas outside all winter
'Cause this summer they ain't finna say, "Next summer I'm finna"
Sittin' in the hood like community colleges
This dope money here is little Trey's scholarship
'Cause ain't no tuition for having no ambition
And ain't no loans for sittin' your ass at home
So we forced to sell crack, rap, and get a job
You gotta do somethin' man, your ass is grown

Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack ya' money till it get sky high
Kids, sing, kids, sing
We wasn't s'posed to make it past twenty-five
Joke's on you, we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
"We don't care what people say"

The second verse is for my dogs workin' nine to five that still hustle
'Cause a nigga can't shine off $6.55
And everybody sellin' makeup, Jacob's and bootlegged tapes just to get they cake up
We put shit on layaway, then come back
We claim other people kids on our income tax
We take that money, cop work, then push packs to get paid
And we don't care what people say
Mama say she wanna move south
Scratchin' lottery tickets, eyes on a new house
'Round the same time, Doe ran up in dude house
Couldn't get a job, so since he couldn't get work, he figured he'd take work
The drug game bulimic, it's hard to get weight
A nigga's money is homo, it's hard to get straight
But we gon' keep bakin' till the day we get cake
And we don't care what people say, my niggas

Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack ya' money till it get sky high
Kids, sing, kids, sing
We wasn't s'posed to make it past twenty-five
Joke's on you, we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
"We don't care what people say"

You know the kids gon' act a fool
When you stop the programs for after-school
And they DCFS, some of 'em dyslexic
They favorite 50 Cent song "12 Questions"
We scream, "Rocks, blow, weed, park," see, now we smart
We ain't retards, the way teachers thought
Hold up, hold fast, we make more cash
Now tell my mama I belong in that slow class
Sad enough we on welfare
They tryna put me on the school bus with the space for the wheelchair
I'm tryna get the car with the chromie wheels here
They tryna cut our lights out like we don't live here
Look what was handed us, fathers abandoned us
When we get them hammers, go on, call the ambulance
Sometimes I feel no one in this world understands us
But we don't care what people say, my niggas

Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack ya' money till it get sky high
Kids, sing, kids, sing
We wasn't s'posed to make it past twenty-five
Joke's on you, we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
"We don't care what people say"
What in the fuck was that Kanye? I told you to do some shit for the kids. 
You give me your muthafuckin' graduation ticket right now. 
You can give me this muthafuckin' robe 
You will not walk across that stage, you won't slide across that stage 
A muthafucker can't pull you across that muthafuckin' stage Kanye 
Who told you see, I told you to do something uplifting 
I'm tryin' to get you out here with these white people and this how you gone do me 
You know what, you's a nigga 
And I don't mean that in no nice way 
Had little kids singin' about the shit, the joke's on you 
You can throw your muthafuckin' hands in the air, and wave good-bye to every-fuckin'-body 
Cause you getting the fuck out of this campus 
Fucker what you gone do now 

I'm no longer confused but don't tell anybody. 
I'm about to break the rules but don't tell anybody. 
I got something better than school but don't tell anybody. 
My daddy would kill me so don't tell anybody. 
He wants me to get a good ass job just like everybody. 
He ain't walked in my shoes, I'm just not everybody.
Oh when it all, it all falls down (Yeah, this the real one baby)
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down (Chi-Town stand up)
Oh when it all, it all falls down (Southside, southside, we gon' set this party off right)
I'm telling you all, it all falls down (Westside, westside, we 'gon set this party off right)
Oh when it all


Man I promise, she's so self-conscious
She has no idea what she's doing in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecure
The concept of school seems so secure
Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a career
She like, "Fuck it, I'll just stay down here and do hair"
'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
'Cause her baby-daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve
And she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail and well


Oh when it all, it all falls down
(And when it all falls down who you gonna call now?) 
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down (C'mon, c'mon)
(And when it falls down) Oh when it all


Man I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pasha's done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that ver-say-see
Then I spent four-hundred bucks on this
Just to be like, "Nigga you ain't up on this"
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some Ones that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seems we living the American dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
We trying to buy back our forty acres
And for that paper, look how low we a stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe


Oh when it all, it all falls down (C'mon, c'mon)
(And when it all falls down who you gonna call now?) 
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down (C'mon, c'mon)
(And when it falls down) Oh when it all


I say fuck the police, that's how I treat 'em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes when we don't really need em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorty's hollerin', "Where the ballers at?"
Drug dealer buy Jordans, crackhead buy crack
And a white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gonna act holier than thou
'Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with twenty-five thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
'Cause I want to be on 106 and Park pushin' a Benz
I want to act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spendin' before I get it
We all self-conscious, I'm just the first to admit it


Oh when it all, it all falls down (Yeah, c'mon, c'mon)
(And when it all falls down who you gonna call now?) 
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down (C'mon, c'mon
(And when it falls down)

Oh when it all, it all falls down (Southside, southside, we gon' set this party off right)
I'm telling you all, it all falls down (Westside, westside, we gon' set this party off right)
Oh when it all, it all falls down (Chi-Town, Chi-Town, we gon' show 'em how we get down)
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down (Now Syleena, you just like a safe belt, you saved my life)
Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down


I's can't keep working like this
This grave shift is like a slave shift
One glad morning
When this life is over
I'll fly away
To a land where
Joy shall never end
I'll fly away

Oh I'll fly away, oh glory
I'll fly away
When I die hallelujah bye and bye
I'll fly away
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit (Yeah, yeah)
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly (Heavens knows) (Me too, I swear I do)
Past the sky (Every night, every night) (Yes, I feel you Ye, I feel you)
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly (Heavens knows)
Past the sky (Every night, every night)


Man, man, man
If my manager insults me again, I will be assaulting him
After I fuck the manager up then I'm gonna shorten the register up
Let's go back, back to the Gap, look at my check, wasn't no scratch
So if I stole, wasn't my fault, yeah I stole, never got caught
They take me to the back and pat me askin' me about some khakis
But let some black people walk in, I bet you they show off their token blackie
Oh now they love Kanye, let's put him all in the front of the store
So I'm on break next to the "No Smokin'" sign with a blunt in the mall
Takin' my hits, writing my hits, writin' my rhymes, playin' my mind
This fuckin' job can't help him so I quit, y'all welcome
Y'all don't know my struggle, y'all can't match my hustle
You can't catch my hustle, you can't fathom my love
Dude, lock yourself in a room doing five beats a day for three summers
That's a Different World like Cree Summer's, I deserve to do these numbers
"The kid that made that deserves that Maybach"
So many records in my basement, I'm just waiting on my spaceship, wow


I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly (Heavens knows)
Past the sky (Every night, every night)
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly (Heavens knows)
Past the sky (Every night, every night)


And I didn't even try to work a job, represent the mob at the same time
Thirsty on the grind, Chi state of mind, lost my momma, lost my mind
My life, my love, that's not mine, "Why you ain't signed?" Wasn't my time
Leave me alone, work for y'all, half of it's yours, half of it's mine
Only one to ball, never one to fall, got to get mine, got to take mine
Got a Tec-9, reach my prime, got to make these haters respect mine
In the mall until twelve when my schedule had said nine
Putting them pants on shelves waiting patiently I ask myself
Where I want to go, where I want to be
Life is much more than running in the streets
Holla at Ye, hit me with the beat
Put me on my feet, sound so sweet
Yes I'm the same ol' G, same goatee, staying low key, nope
Holler at God, "Man why'd you have to take my folks?"
Hope to see Freddie G., Yusef G, love my G
Rolly G., police watch me smoke my weed, count my G's
Got a lot of people counting on me and I'm just trying to find my peace
Should've finished school like my niece then I finally wouldn't use my piece, blow
Aw man, this pressure


I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly (Heavens knows)
Past the sky (Every night, every night)
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly (Heavens knows)
Past the sky (Every night, every night)


Man, you know you gon' do it
I remember having to take the dollar cab, coming home real late at night
Standing on my feet all damn day trying to make this thing right
And having one of my co-workers say "Yo, you look just like
This kid I seen in an old Busta Rhymes video the other night"
Well easy come, easy go, how that saying goes
No more broad service, cars, and them TV shows
I had all that snatched from me, A&Rs and they faculties
All turn their back on me and didn't want to hear a rap from me
So naturally actually had to face things factually
Had to be a catastrophe with the fridges staring back at me
'Cause nothing's there, nothing's fair
I don't want to ever go back there
So I won't be taking no days off till my spaceship takes off


I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly (Heavens knows)
Past the sky (Every night, every night)
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly (Heavens knows)
Past the sky (Every night, every night)


I want to fly, I want to fly
I said I want my chariot to pick me up and take me, brother, for a ride
Heaven knows, heaven knows
Yo
We at war
We at war with terrorism, racism
And most of all, we at war with ourselves

(Jesus walk) God show me the way because the devil's tryna break me down
(Jesus walk with me, with me, with me, with me, with me) Yeah, uh


You know what the Midwest is? Young and restless
Where restless (niggas) might snatch your necklace
And next these (niggas) might jack your Lexus
Somebody tell these (niggas) who Kanye West is
I walk through the valley of the Chi where death is
Top floor the view alone will leave you breathless
Try to catch it, it's kinda hard getting choked by detectives, yeah, yeah, now check the method
They be askin' us questions, harass and arrest us
Sayin' "We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast"
Huh? Y'all eat pieces of shit? What's the basis?
We ain't going nowhere but got suits and cases
A trunk full of coke, rental car from Avis
My mama used to say only Jesus can save us
Well mama I know I act a fool
But I'll be gone till November, I got packs to move, I hope


(Jesus walks) God show me the way because the devil trying to break me down 
(Jesus walk with me) The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
(Jesus walk) And I don't think there's nothing I can do to right my wrong
(Jesus walk with me) I wanna talk to God but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long
(I want Jesus)

(Jesus walks) God show me the way because the devil trying to break me down 
(Jesus walk with me) The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
(Jesus walk) And I don't think there's nothing I can do to right my wrong
(Jesus walk with me) I wanna talk to God but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long
(I want Jesus)


Uh, to the hustlers, killers, murderers, drug dealers, even the scrippers (Jesus walks for them)
To the victims of welfare for we livin' in Hell here, hell yeah (Jesus walks for them)
Now, hear ye, hear ye, want to see thee more clearly
I know he hear me when my feet get weary
'Cause we're the almost nearly extinct
We rappers is role models, we rap, we don't think
I ain't here to argue about his facial features
Or here to convert atheists into believers
I'm just tryna say the way school need teachers
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis, that's the way I need Jesus
So here go my single dog, radio needs this
They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns, sex, lies, videotape
But if I talk about God my record won't get played, huh?
Well if this take away from my spins
Which'll probably take away from my ends
Then I hope this take away from my sins
And bring the day that I'm dreamin' about
Next time I'm in the club, everybody screamin' out


(Jesus walk) God show me the way because the devil trying to break me down
(Jesus walk with me) The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
Oh baby
Hahahahaha, turn it up for me


When it comes to being true, at least true to me (That's right, it's what I do, c'mon)
One thing I found (Uh-huh), one thing I found
Oh no you'll never let me down (No I never let you down)
Get up I get (Down), get up I get (Down)
Get up I get (Down), get up I get (Down)
Get up I get (Down), get up I get (Down)


Yo, first I snatched the streets then I snatched the charts
First I had they ear, now I have their heart
Rappers came and went, I've been here from the start
I seen them put it together, watched them take it apart
Seen the rovers roll up with ribbons
I seen them re-po'd, re-sold, then re-driven
So when I reload, he holds number one position, when you hot, I'm hot
And when your feet cold, mines is sizzling
It's plain to see, niggas can't fuck with me
'Cause I'm a be that nigga for life
This is not an image, this is God given
This is hard livin', mixed with Cristal sippin'
It's the most consistent, Hov
Give you the most hits you can fit inside a whole disc and
Nigga I'm home on these charts, y'all niggas visitin'
It's Hov tradition, Jeff Gordon of rap
I'm back to claim pole position, holla at ya boy


Get up I get (Down), get up I get (Down)
Get up I get (Down), get up I get


Down for my grandfather who took my mama
Made her sit in that seat where white folks ain't want us to eat
At the tender age of six she was arrested for the sit-ins
And with that in my blood I was born to be different
Now niggas can't make it to ballots to choose leadership
But we can make it to Jacob's and to the dealership
Swear I hear new music and I just don't be feelin' it
Racism's still alive, they just be concealin' it
But I know they don't want me in the damn club
They even made me show ID to get inside of Sam's Club
I done did dirt and went to church and get my hands scrubbed
Swear I've been baptized least three or four times
But in the land where niggas praise Yukons and getting paid
Its gonna take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more than doo rags to get you waves
Nothing sad as that day my girl's father passed away
So I promised to Mr. Rainey I'm gonna marry your daughter
And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
And I know that you were smiling when you see the car I bought her
You sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up
But I can't complain what the accident did to my left eye
'Cause look what an accident did to Left Eye
First Aaliyah now Romeo must die
I know I got angels watching me from the other side


When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found, one thing I found
Oh no you'll never let me down
Get up I get (Down), get up I get (Down)
Get up I get (Down), get up I get (Down)
Get up I get (Down), get up I get (Down)


We are all here for a reason on a particular path
You don't need a curriculum to know that you are a part of the math
Cats think I'm delirious but I'm so damn serious
That's why I expose my soul to the globe; the world
I'm trying to make it better for these little boys and girls
I'm not just another individual
My spirit is a part of this that's why I get spiritual
But I get my hymns from Him
So it's not me, it's He that's lyrical
I'm not a miracle, I'm a heaven sent instrument
My rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes
For your soul and your mental
That's why I'm instrumental, vibrations is what I'm into
Yeah I need my loot by rent day
But that ain't what gives me the heart of Kunta Kinte
I'm trying to get us "us free" like Cinque
I can't stop, that's why I'm hot
Determination, dedication, motivation
I'm talking to you of my many inspirations
When I say I can't let you or self down
If I were on the highest cliff, on the highest riff
And if you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life
In my grip I would never ever let you down
And when these words are found
Let it be known that God's penmanship has been signed
With a language called love
That's why my breath is felt by the deaf
And while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
I too dream in color and in rhyme
So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house
'Cause whenever I open my heart, my soul or my mouth
A touch of God reigns out (Take'em to the church)


When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found, one thing I found
Oh no you'll never let me down
Get up I get, get up I get
Get up I get, get up I get
Get up I get, get up I get (down)


Who else you know been hot this long (Oh yeah, we ain't finished)
Started from nothing but he got this strong (The Roc is in the building)
Built the ROC from a pebble, peddled rock before I met you
Peddled bikes, got my nephews pedal bikes because they special (Woo)
Let you tell it man I'm falling, well somebody must have caught him
Every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan them
Number one albums what I got, like four of them
More of them on the way, the eighth wonder on the way
Clear the way, I'm here to stay
Y'all can save the chitter chat, this and that
This is Jay, dissing Jay will get you maced
When I start spitting them lyrics niggas get very religious
Six Hail Mary's please Father forgive us
Young, the archbishop, the Pope John Paul of y'all niggas
They way y'all all follow Jigga
Hov's a living legend and I'll tell you why
Everybody wanna be Hov and Hov's still alive


Down, down
Down, down
Down, down
Uh, uh, I'm trying to catch the beat
Uh, I'm trying to catch the beat
I'm trying to catch the beat
Uh, uh, I'm trying to catch the beat

N-now, th-th-throw your motherfuckin' hands, get 'em high
All the girls pass the weed to your motherfuckin' man, get 'em high
Now I ain't never tell you to put down your hands, keep 'em high
And if you're losin' your high then smoke again, keep 'em high

N-n-n-now, my flow is in the pocket like wallets, I got the bounce like hydraulics
I can't call it, I got the swerve like alcoholics
My freshman year I was going through hella problems
Till I built up the nerve to drop my ass up out of college
My teacher said I's a loser, I told her, "Why don't you kill me?"
I give a fuck if you fail me, I'm gonna follow
My heart, and if you follow the charts or the plaques or the stacks
You ain't gotta guess who's back, you see
I'm so shy that you thought I was bashful
But this bastard's flow will bash your skull
And I will, cut your girl like Pastor Tro'
And I don't, usually smoke but pass the 'dro
And I won't, give you that money that you asking for
Why you think me and Dame cool? We assholes
That's why we hear your music in fast forward
'Cause we don't wanna hear that weak shit no mo'

N-now, th-th-throw your motherfuckin' hands, get 'em high
All the girls pass the weed to your motherfuckin' man, get 'em high
Now I ain't never tell you to put down your hands, keep 'em high
And if you're losin' your high then smoke again, keep 'em high


N-n-n-n-n-now who the hell is this, e-mailing me at 11:26?
Telling me that she 36-26, plus double-d
You know how girls on Black Planet be when they get bubbly
At NYU but she hail from Kansas
Right now she just lamping, chilling on campus
Sent me a picture of her feelin' on Candice
Who said her favorite rapper was the late great Francis
W-H-I-T-E, it's getting late mami
Your screen saver say tweet, so you got to call me
And bring a friend for my friend, his name Kweli
(You mean Talib? Lyrics sticks to your rib)
I mean, (That's my favorite CD that I play at my crib)
I mean, (You don't really know him, why is you lyin'?)
Yo Kwe, she don't believe me, please pick up the line
She gon' think that I'm lyin', just spit a couple of lines
Then maybe I'll be able to give her dick all the time and get her high


Yeah, I can't believe this nigga use my name for picking up dimes
But never mind, I need some tracks, you tryin' to pull tracks out
And my rhymes is finna blow, you trying to blow backs out
Well okay, you twisted my arm, I'll assist with the charm
Ayo, ain't you meet that chick at that conference with your moms?
And sister's the bomb, boy she got the bougie behavior
Always got something to say like a okay playa hater, yeah
Anyway, I don't usually fuck with the Internet
Or chicks with birth control stuck to they arm like Nicorette
You really fuckin' that much or trying to get off cigarettes?
If she think it's fly, she ain't met a real nigga yet
Now I apologize if I come off a little inconsiderate
I got the bubba kush and a sister could get a hit of it (Yo, yo)


Get 'em high like noon or the moon
Or a room filled with smoke, a hype filled with dope
Y'all assumed I was doomed, out of tune
But I still filled the notes with real nigga quotes
Real rappers is hard to find, like a remote
Control rap is out of
Used to, but still got love
That's why I abuse you who are not thugs, rock clubs like Tiger
Woods in the hood, to have my own reality show, called Soul Survivor
I stole on liver, niggas than you
You's a bitch I got ones that are thicker than you
How could I ever let your words affect me?
They say hip hop is dead, I'm here to resurrect me
Marsha's too sexy to even make songs like these
That's why the raw don't know your name, like Alicia Keys
Too many featured emcees, and producers is popular
Twelve thousand spins, nobody got to coppin' a
Album, how come? You the hot garbage of
The year's clear your image and snooped up
Label got you souped up, tellin' you you sick
When you a dick with a loose nut
Video hard to watch like Medusa
Even your club record need a booster
Chimped up, with a pimp cup, illiterate nigga
Read the infra-red across your head, I'm bred king like Simba
Bolder than Denver, I ain't a Madd Rapper, just an emcee with a temper
You dancing for money like Honey, I did this my way
So when the industry crash, I survive like Kanye
Spittin' through wires and fires, emcees retirin'
Got your hands up, get them motherfuckers higher then


N-now, th-th-throw your motherfuckin' hands, get 'em high (Yeah)
All the girls pass the weed to your motherfuckin' man, get 'em high
Now I ain't never tell you to put down your hands, keep 'em high
And if you're losin' your high then smoke again, keep 'em high
Ay what's up girl?
(Hey girl)
(Hey, how you doin'?)
Ay you know I finally got my shit together, been watchin' that workout plan girl
(Well you lookin' all good and stuff, you got you a)
Girl I know it's that workout

Don't say it
(Yo my nigga, my nigga, I'm tired of puttin' 1-8-7 in my nigga's pager that shit ain't workin' no more)
Girl you know I'mma video hofessional now
Since I copped this new workout plan my shit is right rollin' in Lexus, Acuras everything girl
(Girl you need to let me know where I can cop that, how much is it?)
Girl you know you ain't gotta pay nothin' around me I'm the bootleg queen
I'll give it to you for free.99
(FREE.99?)
(That's my dawg you always lookin' out for us)
(Now I can throw away my bus pass and shit oh my God)
(Oh shit)
You just popped in the Kanye West Get Right for the Summer workout tape
And ladies, if you follow these instructions exactly
You might be able to pull you a rapper, a NBA player
Man, at least a dude with a car
So first of all we gonna work on the stomach, nobody wants a little tight ass

One and two and three and four and get them sit-ups right and
Tuck your tummy tight and do your crunches like this
Give head, stop, breathe, get up, check your weave
Don't drop the blunt and disrespect the weed
Pick up your son and don't disrespect your seed
It's a party tonight and ooh she's so excited
"Tell me who's invited," You, your friends and my dick
What's scary to me, Henny makes girls look like Halle Berry to me
So excuse me miss, I forgot your name
Thank you, God bless you, good night I came
I came, I came

It's been a week without me  and she feel weak without me 
She wanna talk it out but ain't nothing to talk about unless
She talkin' about freakin' out then maybe we can work it out (Come on)

Work it out (Come on)
Work it out (Come on)
Work it out (Come on)
Work it out now 
Maybe we can work it out (Come on, come on)

Ooh girl, your silhouette make me wanna light a cigarette
My name Kanye from the Jigga set
Twista said get it wet
Ooh girl, your breath is harsh
Cover your mouth up like you got SARS
Off them tracks yea I bought them cars
Still kill a nigga on sixteen bars
We ain't sweatin' to the oldies, we jukin' to a cold beat
Maybe one day girl we can bone
So you can brag to all your homies now
But I still mess with a big girl
If you ain't fit girl, I'll still hit girl
One and you brought two friends
Okay three more now, hop in the Benz
Four door, do you know the difference between a five, six, seven, eight?
All the mocha lattes, you gotta do pilates
You gotta pop this tape in before you start back-dating
Hustlers, gangstas, all us ballers

It's been a week without me and she feel weak without me
She wanna talk it out but ain't nothing to talk about unless
She talkin' about freakin' out then maybe we can work it out (Come on)

Work it out (Come on)
Work it out (Come on)
Work it out (Come on)
Work it out now
Maybe we can work it out (Come on, come on)

She said she wants some Ready For The World, some New Edition
Some Minnie Ripperton, will definitely set this party off right


I told her to drive over in her new whip
Bring some friends you cool with
I'mma bring the Cool Whip
Then I want you to strip

Then you is my new chick
So we get our grind on
She be grabbin'
Callin' me Biggie like Shyne home

Man I swear she fine, homes
Why she always lying though
Tellin' me them diamonds
When she know they rhinestones

She got a light-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
Got a dark-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
I played Ready For the World, she was ready for some action
My dawg said, 

I'mma play this Vandross
You gon' take your pants off
I'mma play this Gladys Knight
Me and you gon' get it right

She said she wants some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross
A little Anita, will definitely set this party off right


She said she wants some Ready For the World, some New Edition
Some Minnie Ripperton, will definitely set this party off right


Got you lookin' at the gliss, at my hands and wrists
While I'm likely at smokin' on my canibus
When it come to rockin' original like Marvin and Luther
I can tell you ain' no messin' with Kan-man and Twist

From the Chi and I be sippin' Hennessy
Twistin A-marie
Try'na Smoke a B
Lookin' properly
Feelin' on a G
And always 

Come with me and sip on some regular champagne
You ain't know Twista can work it like The Whispers
Hit the stop light, get into some Isaac
The rims still moving, so I'm bumpin' a little Spinners

While I'm smokin' On a B
Dippin' through the streets
Bumpin' R&B and I got to leave
On the 23's
And I do it 

When my earth and the wind smoke a fire
Let my get your sheets wet listening to Keith Sweat
Put you in a daze For Maze
Fulfilling our every sensation, slow jammin', having deep sex

You Ready For the World girl
Come on over, make me touch you all over your body, baby don't say no to me
And every moment you controllin' me, I'm lovin' the way you be
Holding me when I been listening to Jodeci

And when I come over and bend your ass
You be bumpin' Teddy Pendergrass
I'da hit it from the back to the melody to roll it slow
Now I gotta go up in it fast, but I'mma finish last

No matter how much of a thug you see
I still spit it like it's R&B, o to the club with me
And with some Luther Come On and Hope
You finna and stilla be in love with me

She said she wants some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross
A little Anita, will definitely set this party off right


She said she wants some Ready For the World, some New Edition
Some Minnie Ripperton, will definitely set this party off right


Baby drop another slow jam
And all us lovers need to hold hands
And if you ain't got no man, hop up on my Brougham
I keep it pimpin' like an old man
You gots ta roll with the plan

'Cause after that then I
Take it to the dome
Then I got to bone
Stay up in the zone
Got to get you home
Gotta run up on
And I do it 

Baby drop another slow jam
And all us lovers need to hold hands
And if you ain't got no man, hop up on my Brougham
I keep it pimpin' like an old man
You gots ta roll with the plan

'Cause after that then I
Take you to my home
And we could get it on
Whisper on the phone
Just to get you goin'
Try'na make you moan
And I do it
[Hook: Ludacris]
Yeah, breathe in, breathe out
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out
Girls go wild and pull ya deez out
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert Eag' out
When I pull the piece out niggas like "Peace out!"

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Golly, more of that bullshit ice rap
I got to 'pologize to Mos and Kweli (probably)
But is it cool to rap about gold
If I told the world I copped it from Ghana and Mali? (Mali!)
First nigga with a Benz and a backpack
Ice chain, Cardi lens, and a knapsack
Always said if I rapped I'd say somethin' significant
But now I'm rappin' 'bout money, hoes, and rims again
And it's still about the Benjamins
Big faced hundreds and whatever other synonyms
Strippers named Cinnamon
More chips than Pentium
What'cha gon' buy next? Whatever new trend it is
I'm tryin' to spend my stacks
And I'm so broke I look back like "Damn, was I on crack?"
I mean twelve platinum chains, was I on that?
What the hell was wrong with me dog?
Sing along with my y'all

[Hook: Ludacris]
Yeah, breathe in, breathe out
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out
Girls go wild and pull ya deez out
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert Eag' out
When I pull the piece out niggas like "Peace out!"

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Now even though I went to college and dropped out of school quick
I always had a Ph.D.: a Pretty Huge Dick
Ladies tired of gettin' ripped off by guys like this
And givin' head is like 'oh well, the shoes and the toothpick'
Well, I'm in the club for a limited time
Act now and get some action for free-99
Later on I might charge for ménage
Heard her man was the boss of the floss
But she still want to toss me the drawers
And it ain't gon' cost me because she my caddy
Cuz she grabbed my golf balls in the club
And I'm still actin' calm than a mug
She asked "Can you drive me and the hunnies to where my Altima was?"
While we drive she tellin' me 'bout problems with her man
Baby I fully understand
Let me help you with a plan
While he trickin' off, don't get no rich nigga
Give ME some head, that'll really piss him off
[inhales]

[Hook: Ludacris]
Yeah, breathe in, breathe out
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out
Girls go wild and pull ya deez out
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert Eag' out
When I pull a piece out niggas like "Peace out!"

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I blow past low class niggas with no cash
In the fo' dash six, bitch you can go ask
So when I go fast popo just laugh
Right until I run out of gas or 'til I go crash
Whatever comes first I'm prepared for the worst
Whatever comes second I'll be there with my weapon
Pullin' up in the Lexuses, one on both hand
So I guess them GSes was ambidextrous
Coulda sworn her breasteses was sendin' me messages
"K I need a free hand mammogram
I got weed, drink, and a Handicam
All of which is legal in Amsterdam"
So say my name like Candyman
And I'ma come and fix you up like the handyman
But if you don't need a fix, girl you gotta leave
You can't take that all at one time ya gotta breathe

[Hook: Ludacris]
Yeah, breathe in, breathe out
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out
Girls go wild and pull ya deez out
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert Eag' out
When I pull a piece out niggas like "Peace out!"

["Can you say Chi city?" scratched repeatedly]
Now beat that. 
And your mother's sayin' go to college 
So you finish college and it's wonderful 
You feel so good. 
Now after all the partying and crazin', 
And don't forget about that drug habit you picked up at school bein' around your peers 
Hey! Now you'll get that 25 thous job a year 
And you'll spend all your money on crack-cocaine 
But it'll be your money. 
No more borrowing from mom for my high 
So now you get your degree tattooed on your back you're so excited about it 

If you continue to work at the Gap 
After several interviews 
Oh My God, you'll come in at an entry level position 
And when you do that, if you kiss enough ass 
You'll move up to the next level, 
Which is bein' a secretary's secretary! 
And boy is that great. 
You get to take messages for the secretary who never went to college 
She's actually the boss's niece! 
So now you're part of the family 

You know what college does for you? 
It makes you really smart man. 
All you kids wanted talk in the back of the class? 
Not me, I listened, OK
I was a hall-monitor. 
It was meant to be. 
You know how many classes I took? 
Extra classes, extra classes 
No I've never had sex! 
But ya know what? 
My degree keeps me satisfied. 

When a lady walked wit' me she say 
Ya know what's sexy? 
No I don't know what it is 
But I bet I could add up all the change in your purse, 
Very fast

Chasing y'all dreams and what you've got planned
Now I spit it so hot, you got tanned
Back to school and I hate it there, I hate it there

Rosary piece, yeah that's my Catholic style
Red and white One's, yeah that's my Kappa style and I ain't even pledge

Then you get your master's masters, then you get your doctrine, you go man

Hate all you want but I'm smart, I'm so smart, and I'm in school
And these guys are out here making money all these ways, and I'm spendin' mine to be smart
You know why?
Because when I die, buddy, you know what going to keep me warm?
That's right, those degrees

We in the streets, playa, get ya mail
It's only two places you end up, either dead or in jail
Still nowhere to go
Still nowhere to go

Now throw ya hands up hustlers, busters, boosters, hoes
Everybody, fuck that
Still nowhere to go
Still nowhere to go


Two words, United States, no love, no breaks
Low brow, high stakes, crack smoke, black folks
Big Macs, fat folks, ecstasy capsules
Presidential scandals, everybody move
Two words, Mos Def, K. West, hot shit
Calm down, get back, ghetto people got this
Game 'pon lock shit, gun 'pon cock shit

And keep ya hands up hustlers
Busters, boosters, hoes (Till they reach the sky)
Everybody, fuck that
Still nowhere to go

Ayo, two words, Chi-town, South Side, worldwide
'Cause I rep that till I fuckin' die
One neck two chains, one waist two gats
One wall twenty plaques, dues paid, gimme that
I am limelight, Blueprint five mics
Go Getters rhyme like, should've been signed twice
Most imitated, Grammy nominated
Hotel accommodated, cheerleader prom-dated
Barbershop playa-hated, mom-and-pop bootlegged it
Felt like it rained till the roof caved in
Two words, Chi-town raised me crazy
So I live by two words, "Fuck you, pay me"
Screamin', "Jesus save me"
You know how the game be, I can't let 'em change me
Cause on judgment day, you gon' blame me
Look, God, it's the same me
And I basically know now, we get racially profiled
Cuffed up and hosed down, pimped up and ho'd down
Plus I got a whole city to hold down
From the bottom so the top's the only place to go now


Now throw ya hands up hustlers, busters, boosters, hoes (Throw your hands up high)
Everybody, fuck that
Still nowhere to go
Still nowhere to go


Two words, free way, two letters, AR
Turn y'all rap niggas to two words, fast runners
Like Jackie Joyner, you better sleep with your burner
The heat skeet, blow a reef through ya car, my God
Two words, no guns, break arms
Break necks, break backs, Steven Seagal free
Young boss, freshman of the Roc
With the beef in the pot Jay sent for his dogs to brawl
Forget ya squad, better fend for yourself
Have you screamin' out four words, "Send for the law", uh
Two words, Freeway slightly retarded
Fuck around, throw a clip in ya artist, leave with his broad


Red, white, blue, black (Throw your hands up)
Calm down, move back
Motherfuckers askin', "Who is that?"
You know it's the almighty Black Jack
Mos Def, K. West
Ghetto people get this shit off ya chest
North to the south, to the east, to the west
Black Jack Johnson, it's no contest
(High) And show it to 'em like
Let me hear that, this is some two chain reberish, shit outta the way
Yo Gee, they can't stop me from rapping, can they? Can they, Hop?
I spit it through the wire, man (Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall)
There's too much stuff on my heart right now, man (For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all)
I'd gladly risk it all right now (Through the fire, through whatever come my way)
It's a life-or-death situation, man (For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way)
Y'all, y'all don't really understand how I feel right now
It's your boy Kanye to the, Chi-town, what's goin' on? (Right down to the wire, even through the fire)
Uh huh, yeah, yeah


I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wizerk
How do you console my mom or give her light support?
Telling her her son's on life support and just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane, scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she been trying to be mine
She a Delta, so she been throwing that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryin to be lyin', I been trying to be signed
Trying to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't trying to make a band
I swear this right here, history in the making, man


I really apologize for everything right now, if it's unclear at all, man (Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall)
They got my mouth wired shut for like I dunno, the doctor said like six weeks (For chance to be with you I'd gladly risk it all)
Y'know he had reconstru- I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw (Through the fire, through whatever come my way)
I looked in the mirror and half my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man, I couldn't believe it (For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way)
But I'm still here for y'all right now, man, this what I got to say right here, dawg (Right down to the wire, even through the fire)
Yeah, turn me up, yeah, uh


What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal on the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talking about coke and birds, it was more like spoken word except he's really putting it down?
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory and what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time in the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt, you would know how Mase felt
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God driver two wants to sue
I got a lawyer for the case to keep what's in my safe safe
My dogs couldn't tell if I, I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, it was televised
There's been an accident like Geico
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel 'cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what you thought, they'd call me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys "R" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire


Y'know what I'm saying? (Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall)
When the doctor told me I had, um, that I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin, I said (For chance to be with you I'd gladly risk it all)
"Dawg, don't you realize I'll never make it on a plane now?
It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on!" Haha (Through the fire, through whatever come my way)
She can't be serious, man (For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way)
(Right down to the wire, even through the fire)


Through the fire, to the limit
Through the fire, through whatever
Through the fire, to the limit
Through the fire, through whatever
Through the fire, to the limit
How's your son? (all, all, all the things, things)
He make the team this year? (all, all, all the things things)
Aw th-, they said he wasn't tall enough?
(all, all, all that glitters is not gold)
Yeah me we gon' cook this up (all gold is not reality)
(real is what you live to be)

This is family business
And this is for the family that can't be with us
And this is for my cousin locked down, know the answer's in us
That's why I spit it in my songs so sweet
Like a photo of your granny's picture
Now that you're gone it hit us
Super hard on Thanksgiving and Christmas, this can't be right
Yeah you heard the track I did man, this can't be life
Somebody please say grace so I can save face
And have a reason to cover my face
I even made you a plate, soul food, know how Granny do it
Monkey bread on the side, know how the family do it
When I brought it why did the guard have to look all through it?
As kids we used to laugh
Who knew that life would move this fast?
Who knew I'd have to look at you through a glass?
And look, you tell me you ain't did it, then you ain't did it
And if you did, then that's family business

And I don't care 'bout (all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)
They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)
All these fancy things
I tell you that all (all the glitter is not gold) my weight in gold (gold is not reality)
Now all I know I know all these things (real is what you live to be)

This is family business
And this is for everybody standin' with us
Come on, let's take a family Grammy picture
Abby, remember when they ain't believe in me?
Now she like, "See, that's my cousin on TV"
Now, we gettin' it and we gon' make it
And y'all gon' hate it and I'm his favorite
I can't deny it, I'm a straight rider
But when we get together be electric slidin'
Grandma, get 'em shook up
Aw naw, don't open the photo book up
I got an Aunt Ruth that can't remember your name
But I bet them Polaroids'll send her down memory lane
You know that one auntie, you don't mean to be rude
But every holiday nobody eatin' her food
And you don't wanna stay there 'cause them your worst cousins
Got roaches at their crib like them your first cousins
Act like you ain't took a bath with your cousins
Fit three in the bed while six of y'all
I'm talkin' 'bout three by the head and three by the leg
But you ain't have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bed

Rain, rain, rain go away
Let the sun come out and all the children say
Rain, rain, rain go away
Let the sun come out and all the children say

I woke up early this mornin' with a new state of mind
A creative way to rhyme without usin' knives and guns
Keep your nose out the sky, keep your heart to God
And keep your face to the risin' sun
All my niggas from the Chi, that's my family dog
And my niggas ain't my guys, they my family dog
I feel like one day you'll understand me dog
You can still love your man and be manly dog
You ain't got to get heated at every house warmin'
Sittin' here, grillin' people like George Foreman
Why Uncle Ray and Aunt Sheila always performin'?
The second she storm out, then he storm in
Y'all gon' sit down, have a good time this reunion
And drink some wine like Communion
And act like everything fine and if it isn't
We ain't lettin' everybody in our family business

(all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)
They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)
They don't mean a thing
(all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)
They don't mean a thing, a thing

And I don't care 'bout (all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)
They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)
All these fancy things
I tell you that all (all the glitter is not gold) my weight in gold (gold is not reality)
Now all I know I know all these things (real is what you live to be)

(oooh) All these things (these things)
All these things (oooh) all these things (these things)
All these things (oooh) all these things (these things)
All these things (oooh) all these things (these things)
All these things (oooh) all these things (these things)
All these things (oooh) all these things (these things)
All these things (oooh) all these things (these things)
All these things (oooh) all these things (these things)
Yo, fuck you, Kanye, first and foremost

I'd like to propose a toast
I said toast motherfucker


And I am (Here's to the Roc)
And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them (Here's to Roc-A-Fella)
Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky and (Here's to the Roc)
This is the last call for alcohol, for the (Mr. Rockefeller)
So get your ass up off the wall


The all around the world Digital Underground Pac
The Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer of the Roc
I take my chain, my fifteen seconds of fame
And come back next year with the whole fucking game
Ain't nobody expect Kanye to end up on top
They expected that College Dropout to drop and then flop
Then maybe he stop savin' all the good beats for himself
Roc-A-Fella's only niggas that helped
My money was thinner than Sean Paul's goatee hair
Now Jean Paul Gaultier cologne fill the air, here
They say he bougie, he big-headed
Would you please stop talking about how my dick head is
Flow infectious, give me ten seconds
I'll have a buzz bigger than insects in Texas
It's funny how wasn't nobody interested
Till the night I almost killed myself in Lexus

Kanye West and Bette Midler:
And I am (Here's to the Roc)
And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them (Here's to Roc-A-Fella)
Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky and (Here's to the Roc)
This is the last call for alcohol, for the (Mr. Rockefeller)
So get your ass up off the wall


Now was Kanye the most overlooked? Yes sir
Now is Kanye the most overbooked? Yes sir
Though the fans want the feeling of A Tribe Called Quest
But all they got left is this guy called West
That'll take Freeway, throw him on tracks with Mos Def
Call him Kwali or Kweli, I put him on songs with Jay-Z
I'm the Gap like Banana Republic and Old Navy, and ooh
It come out sweeter than old Sadie
Nice as Bun-B when I met him at the Source awards
Girl he had with him, ass coulda won the horse awards
And I was almost famous, now everybody love Kanye, I'm almost Raymond
Some say he arrogant, can y'all blame him?
It was straight embarrassing how y'all played him
Last year shoppin' my demo, I was tryin' to shine
Every motherfucker told me that I couldn't rhyme
Now I could let these dream killers kill my self-esteem
Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams
I use it as my gas, so they say that I'm gassed
But without it I'd be last, so I ought to laugh
So I don't listen to the suits behind the desk no more
You niggas wear suits 'cause you can't dress no more
You can't say shit to Kanye West no more
I rocked twenty thousand people, I was just on tour, nigga
I'm Kan, the Louis Vuitton Don
Bought my mom a purse, now she Louis Vuitton Mom
I ain't play the hand I was dealt, I changed my cards
I prayed to the skies and I changed my stars
I went to the malls and I balled too hard
"Oh my god, is that a black card?"
I turned around and replied, "Why yes
But I prefer the term African American Express"
Brains, power, and muscle, like Dame, Puffy, and Russell
Your boy back on his hustle, you know what I've been up to
Killin' y'all niggas on that lyrical shit
Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push Miracle Whips


And I am (Here's to the Roc)
And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them (Here's to Roc-A-Fella)
Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky and (Here's to the Roc)
This is the last call for alcohol, for my niggas (Mr. Rockefeller)
So get your ass up off the wall, all


So this A&R over at Roc-A-Fella, named Hip Hop picked the "Truth" beat for Beanie and I was in the session with him
I had my demo with me, you know, like I always do
I play the songs, he's like "Who that spittin'?" I'm like "It's me," he's like "Oh, well okay"
Uh, he started talkin' to me on the phone, going back and forth
Just askin' me to send him beats, and I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers, 'cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin' with
And um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID
And No ID told him, "Look man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap"
(Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap)
I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper and a producer
(I'll sign you as a producer and a rapper)
I'm like "Oh shit"
I was messin' with, uh, D-Dot also
People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how I got in the game
If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here
So you know, after they picked that Truth beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin' off like that
I was stayin' in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and be able to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off layaway, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then
I made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample
I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, "Oh, yo that shit is crazy, Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin', called the Dynasty"
And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me
So I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time and really I just, like bit the drums off "Xxplosive" and put it like with it sped up, sampled
And now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on "This Can't be Life"
And that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on the Dynasty album
I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound and you know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management
I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop 'cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm sayin' 'cause I been there for a while I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change to try to move up to the next level
And that day, I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet Jay-Z and he said, "Oh you a real soulful dude"
(Oh you a real soulful dude, man)
And he, uh, played the song 'cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio, you know how he do it, one take
And he said, "Tell me what you think of this"
(Check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here)
And I heard it, and I was thinking like, "Man, I really wanted more like of the simple type Jay-Z"
I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the in my personal opinion
So he asked me, "What you think of it?"
(So what you think of this?)
And I was like, "Man that shit tight"
You know what I'm sayin', man what I'mma tell him?
I was on the train, man, you know
So after that I went back home and man I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing
You know, I got groups, I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin really like, poppin' off the way it should have been
One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed
But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company
So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company
And I got evicted at the same time
So I went down and tracked the beats from him
I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out
So I ain't have to deal with the landlord 'cause he's a jerk
Me and my mother drove to Newark, New Jersey
(Come on, let's just go)
I hadn't even seen my apartment
I remember I pulled up, I unpacked all my shit
(Kanye, baby, we're here)
You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself
I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, "Heart of the City"
And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats
And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did "Nothing Like It" already at that time
But then Jay walked in, I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on
I remember it like, like it was yesterday
And Hip Hop said, "Yo play that one beat for him"
So I played "Heart of the City" and really I made "Heart of the City," I really wanted to give that beat to DMX
(No I think Jay gon' like this one right here)
And I played another beat, and I played another beat and I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like, "Ooh"
Two days later, I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame
Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, "Yo, what's up I'm Kanye"
(Yo, you that kid, Kanye?)
"You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics to beats G"
(Yo, Jay got classics, G)
You know I ain't talkin shit
I'm like, "Oh shit"
And all this time, I'm starstruck, man, I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin', these were superstars in my eyes and they still are, you know
So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days
I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story
The day I did the 'Can't Be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S., he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly
And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people
I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, "Yo Jay I could rap"
And I spit this rap that said, uh, "I'm killin' y'all niggas on that lyrical shit
Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips"
And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line
But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response, he said, "Man, that was tight"
(That, that was cool, that was hot)
That was it, you know, I ain't get no deal then, haha
Okay, fast forward
So, Blueprint, "H to the Izzo," my first hit single
And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people, my relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper
Because, you know, of course later he allowed me to go on tour with him
Man, yo, I appreciate, I love him for that
And at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats
"Gimme a beat that sound like Jay-Z," You know, they dick riders, whatever
So I'll play them these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll
Be like, "Yo but I rap too." Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy 'cause you know, 'cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever
Everybody out there listen here, I played them "Jesus Walks" and they didn't sign me
You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say "Naw"
Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me, my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels, Jessica Rivera, man
(Man, you niggas is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for real)
I'm not gonna say nothin' to mess my promotion up
(Y'all niggas is stupid)
Let's just say I didn't get my deal
The nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know?
The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records
He wanted to sign me really bad
(We gonna change the game, buddy)
Dame was like, "Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay man, just make sure it's not wack"
(You gotta make sure it's not wack)
Then one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, 'cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and
Dame was in the room
So I played, actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it
So, it's called "Wow"
"I go to Jacob with twenty-five thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow
I got eleven plaques on my walls right now
You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow," like the chorus went
Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it
So I play that song for him, and he's like, "Oh shit"
(Oh shit, it's not even wack)
"I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot"
(It's actually kinda hot)
Like they still weren't looking at me like a rapper
And I'm sure Dame figured, "Like man, if he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know
So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's like "Yo man, B, B, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick"
(You don't wanna catch a brick)
"You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on"
I told Hip Hop and Hip Hop was all, "Oh, word?"
Actually, even with that I was still about to take the deal with Capitol 'cause it was already on the table and 'cause of my relationship with 3H
That, you know, 'cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do
Then, you know, I'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, "Oh he's just a producer rapper" and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right
The day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do man, I had picked out clothes
I already started booking studio sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man I was ready to go
And they had Mel call me, they said, "Yo
Capitol pulled on the deal"
(Yo, Capitol pulled out on the deal)
And, you know I told them that Roc-A-Fella was interested
And I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever
I went up
I called G, I said, "Man, you think we could still get that deal with Roc-A-Fella?"


So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
Yo Gee, they can't stop me from rapping, can they? Can they, Hop?
I spit it through the wire, man (Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall)
There's too much stuff on my heart right now, man (For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all)
I'd gladly risk it all right now (Through the fire, through whatever come my way)
It's a life-or-death situation, man (For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way)
Y'all, y'all don't really understand how I feel right now
It's your boy Kanye to the, Chi-town, what's goin' on? (Right down to the wire, even through the fire)
Uh huh, yeah, yeah


I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wizerk
How do you console my mom or give her light support?
Telling her her son's on life support and just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane, scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she been trying to be mine
She a Delta, so she been throwing that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryin to be lyin', I been trying to be signed
Trying to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't trying to make a band
I swear this right here, history in the making, man


I really apologize for everything right now, if it's unclear at all, man (Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall)
They got my mouth wired shut for like I dunno, the doctor said like six weeks (For chance to be with you I'd gladly risk it all)
Y'know he had reconstru- I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw (Through the fire, through whatever come my way)
I looked in the mirror and half my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man, I couldn't believe it (For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way)
But I'm still here for y'all right now, man, this what I got to say right here, dawg (Right down to the wire, even through the fire)
Yeah, turn me up, yeah, uh


What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal on the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talking about coke and birds, it was more like spoken word except he's really putting it down?
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory and what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time in the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt, you would know how Mase felt
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God driver two wants to sue
I got a lawyer for the case to keep what's in my safe safe
My dogs couldn't tell if I, I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, it was televised
There's been an accident like Geico
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel 'cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what you thought, they'd call me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys "R" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire


Y'know what I'm saying? (Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall)
When the doctor told me I had, um, that I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin, I said (For chance to be with you I'd gladly risk it all)
"Dawg, don't you realize I'll never make it on a plane now?
It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on!" Haha (Through the fire, through whatever come my way)
She can't be serious, man (For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way)
(Right down to the wire, even through the fire)


Through the fire, to the limit
Through the fire, through whatever
Through the fire, to the limit
Through the fire, through whatever
Through the fire, to the limit
Ay what's up girl?
(Hey girl)
(Hey, how you doin'?)
Ay you know I finally got my shit together, been watchin' that workout plan girl
(Well you lookin' all good and stuff, you got you a)
Girl I know it's that workout
(Got you a six pack Shakur and stuff)
Don't say it
(Yo my nigga, my nigga, I'm tired of puttin' 1-8-7 in my nigga's pager that shit ain't workin' no more)
Girl you know I'mma video hofessional now
Since I copped this new workout plan my shit is right rollin' in Lexus, Acuras everything girl
(Girl you need to let me know where I can cop that, how much is it?)
Girl you know you ain't gotta pay nothin' around me I'm the bootleg queen
I'll give it to you for free.99
(FREE.99?)
(That's my dawg you always lookin' out for us)
(Now I can throw away my bus pass and shit oh my God)
(Oh shit)
Oh when it all, it all falls down (Yeah, this the real one baby)
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down (Chi-Town stand up)
Oh when it all, it all falls down (Southside, southside, we gon' set this party off right)
I'm telling you all, it all falls down (Westside, westside, we 'gon set this party off right)
Oh when it all


Man I promise, she's so self-conscious
She has no idea what she's doing in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecure
The concept of school seems so secure
Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a career
She like, "Fuck it, I'll just stay down here and do hair"
'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
'Cause her baby-daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve
And she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail and well


Oh when it all, it all falls down
(And when it all falls down who you gonna call now?) 
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down (C'mon, c'mon)
(And when it falls down) Oh when it all


Man I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pasha's done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that ver-say-see
Then I spent four-hundred bucks on this
Just to be like, "Nigga you ain't up on this"
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some Ones that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seems we living the American dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
We trying to buy back our forty acres
And for that paper, look how low we a stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe


Oh when it all, it all falls down (C'mon, c'mon)
(And when it all falls down who you gonna call now?) 
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down (C'mon, c'mon)
(And when it falls down) Oh when it all


I say fuck the police, that's how I treat 'em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes when we don't really need em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorty's hollerin', "Where the ballers at?"
Drug dealer buy Jordans, crackhead buy crack
And a white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gonna act holier than thou
'Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with twenty-five thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
'Cause I want to be on 106 and Park pushin' a Benz
I want to act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spendin' before I get it
We all self-conscious, I'm just the first to admit it


Oh when it all, it all falls down (Yeah, c'mon, c'mon)
(And when it all falls down who you gonna call now?) 
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down (C'mon, c'mon
(And when it falls down)

Oh when it all, it all falls down (Southside, southside, we gon' set this party off right)
I'm telling you all, it all falls down (Westside, westside, we gon' set this party off right)
Oh when it all, it all falls down (Chi-Town, Chi-Town, we gon' show 'em how we get down)
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down (Now Syleena, you just like a safe belt, you saved my life)
Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down


I's can't keep working like this
This grave shift is like a slave shift
Yo
We at war
We at war with terrorism, racism
And most of all, we at war with ourselves

(Jesus walk) God show me the way because the devil's tryna break me down
(Jesus walk with me, with me, with me, with me, with me) Yeah, uh


You know what the Midwest is? Young and restless
Where restless (niggas) might snatch your necklace
And next these (niggas) might jack your Lexus
Somebody tell these (niggas) who Kanye West is
I walk through the valley of the Chi where death is
Top floor the view alone will leave you breathless
Try to catch it, it's kinda hard getting choked by detectives, yeah, yeah, now check the method
They be askin' us questions, harass and arrest us
Sayin' "We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast"
Huh? Y'all eat pieces of shit? What's the basis?
We ain't going nowhere but got suits and cases
A trunk full of coke, rental car from Avis
My mama used to say only Jesus can save us
Well mama I know I act a fool
But I'll be gone till November, I got packs to move, I hope


(Jesus walks) God show me the way because the devil trying to break me down 
(Jesus walk with me) The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
(Jesus walk) And I don't think there's nothing I can do to right my wrong
(Jesus walk with me) I wanna talk to God but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long
(I want Jesus)

(Jesus walks) God show me the way because the devil trying to break me down 
(Jesus walk with me) The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
(Jesus walk) And I don't think there's nothing I can do to right my wrong
(Jesus walk with me) I wanna talk to God but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long
(I want Jesus)


Uh, to the hustlers, killers, murderers, drug dealers, even the scrippers (Jesus walks for them)
To the victims of welfare for we livin' in Hell here, hell yeah (Jesus walks for them)
Now, hear ye, hear ye, want to see thee more clearly
I know he hear me when my feet get weary
'Cause we're the almost nearly extinct
We rappers is role models, we rap, we don't think
I ain't here to argue about his facial features
Or here to convert atheists into believers
I'm just tryna say the way school need teachers
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis, that's the way I need Jesus
So here go my single dog, radio needs this
They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns, sex, lies, videotape
But if I talk about God my record won't get played, huh?
Well if this take away from my spins
Which'll probably take away from my ends
Then I hope this take away from my sins
And bring the day that I'm dreamin' about
Next time I'm in the club, everybody screamin' out


(Jesus walk) God show me the way because the devil trying to break me down
(Jesus walk with me) The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
