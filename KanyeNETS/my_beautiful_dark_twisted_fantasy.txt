You might think you've peeped the scene
You haven't, the real one's far too mean
The watered down one, the one you know
Was made up centuries ago
It made it sound all whack and corny
Yes, it's awful, blasted boring
Twisted fiction, sick addiction
Well gather 'round children, zip it, listen


(Can we get much higher?)
So high, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh (Can we get much higher?)
So high, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh can we get much higher?
So high, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh can we get much higher?
So high, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh


Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

I fantasized 'bout this back in Chicago
Mercy, mercy me, that Murcielago
That's me, the first year that I blow
How you say broke in Spanish? Me no hablo
Me drown sorrow in that Diablo
Me found bravery in my bravado
DJs need to listen to the models
You ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy in your Serrato?
(You ain't got no Yeezy, nigga?)
Stupid, but what the fuck do I know?
I'm just a Chi-town nigga with a Nas flow
And my bitch in that new Phoebe Philo
So much head, I woke up in Sleepy Hollow


Can we get much higher? 
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)


Look like a fat booty Celine Dion
Sex is on fire, I'm the King of Leon-a Lewis, beyond the truest
Hey, teacher, teacher, tell me how do you respond to students
And refresh the page and restart the memory
Respark the soul and rebuild the energy?
We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemy
Sorry for the night demons still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air, rolling down the window
Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low
Don't make me pull the toys out, huh
Don't make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines, huh
And then they make noise, oh


Can we get much higher?
So high, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh


At the mall, there was a seance
Just kids, no parents
Then the sky filled with herons
(I saw the devil) In a Chrysler LeBaron
And the hell, it wouldn't spare us
And the fires did declare us
But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress
And woke up back in Paris


(Can we get much higher?)
So high, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

(Can we get much higher?)
So high, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(Can we get much higher?)
So high, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Can we get much higher?
So high, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher?
So high, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher?
So high, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Not for nothing I've forseen it, I dream it
I can feel it slowly dripping away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down


Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of autumn
All of them fallin' for the love of ballin'
Got caught with thirty rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter-century anthems based off inner city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport they check all through my bag and tell me that it's random
But we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
And a new fitted and some job opportunities thats lucrative
This the real world, homie, school finished
They done stole your dreams, you dunno who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won't be satisfied till all my niggas get it, get it?


Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down


Is hip hop just a euphemism for a new religion?
The soul music for the slaves that the youth is missing
But this is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as I'm in Polo's smilin' they think they got me
But they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me
If a nigga ain't running shootin a jump shot running a track meet
But this pimp is, at the top of Mount Olympus
Ready for the World's game, this is my Olympics
We make 'em say ho 'cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a South Park writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up off a this dick
And these drugs, niggas can't resist it
Remind me of when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever wasn't the greatest, nigga, I must have missed it


Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down


I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said, "Take them glasses off and get in the pool"
It's been a while since I watched the tube
'Cause like a Crip said, "I got way too many blues for any more bad news"
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history I don't believe in yesterday
And what's a black Beatle anyway? A fucking roach
I guess that's why they got me sitting in fucking coach
But God said I need a different approach
'Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffing coke
It's not funny anymore, try different jokes
Tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, X and O
Kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic and end all of that wack shit
Act like I aint had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it I'm going after whoever who has it
I'm coming after whoever who has it?
You blowing up, that's good, fantastic
That y'all, it's like that ya'll
I don't really give a fuck about it at all
'Cause the same people that tried to black ball me forgot about two things, my black balls


Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down


Ayo, I done copped Timb's, lived in lenses, kid
Armani suits, fresh fruits, Bally boots, and Benzes
Counting up, smoking, one cuff
Live as a red Jag, a Louis bag, grabbing a blunt, fuck it
Steam about a hundred and one L's
Kites off to jails, buying sweats, running up in Stetson
Nigga hat game was special
It matched every black pair of Nikes, throwing dice for decimals
The older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head
Make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead
That meant code red, bent off the black skunk
The black Dutch, back of the old shed
If you can't live, you dying, you give or buy in
Keep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding
Keep shining, to every young man, this is a plan
Learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye


Not for nothing I've forseen it, I dream it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
I'm livin' in that 21st century, doin' something mean to it
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the haters, got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his theme music


No one man should have all that power
The clock's tickin', I just count the hours
Stop trippin', I'm trippin' off the power
(21st century schizoid man)


The system broken, the schools closed, the prisons open
We ain't got nothin' to lose, motherfucker, we rollin'
Huh? Motherfucker, we rollin'
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
In this white man world, we the ones chosen
So good night, cruel world, I see you in the mornin'
Huh? I see you in the mornin'
This is way too much, I need a moment

No one man should have all that power
The clock's tickin', I just count the hours
Stop trippin', I'm trippin' off the power
Till then, fuck that, the world's ours


And then they (Go)
And then they
And then they (Go)
And then they

And then they (Go)
And then they
(21st century schizoid man)


Ooh, fuck SNL and the whole cast
Tell 'em Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
More specifically, they can kiss my asshole
I'm an asshole? You niggas got jokes
You short-minded niggas' thoughts is Napoleon
My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in
Now I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He knows he so fuckin' gifted
I just needed time alone with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind, but couldn't open up my own vault
My childlike creativity, purity, and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catchin' up with me
Takin' my inner child, I'm fighting for it, custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my diamond-encrusted piece

Thinkin' no one man should have all that power
The clock's tickin', I just count the hours
Stop trippin', I'm trippin' off the powder
Till then, fuck that, the world's ours


And then they (Go)
And then they
And then they (Go)
And then they

And then they (Go)
And then they
(21st century schizoid man)


Colin Powers, Austin Powers
Lost in translation with a whole fuckin' nation
They say I was the abomination of Obama's nation
Well, that's a pretty bad way to start the conversation
At the end of day, goddammit, I'm killin' this shit
I know damn well y'all feelin' this shit
I don't need yo' pussy, bitch, I'm on my own dick
I ain't gotta power trip, who you goin' home with?
How Ye doin'? I'm survivin'
I was drinkin' earlier, now I'm drivin'
Where the bad bitches, huh? Where ya hidin'?
I got the power, make yo' life so excitin'

Now this'll be a beautiful death
(I'm jumpin' out the window
Lettin' everything go
Lettin' everything go)

Now this'll be a beautiful death
(Jumpin' out the window
Lettin' everything go
Lettin' everything go)

Now this'll be a beautiful death
(Jumpin' out the window
Lettin' everything go
Lettin' everything go)
You got the power to let power go?

Bitch, I'm a monster, no good blood sucker
Fat motherfucker, now look who's in trouble
As you run through my jungles all you hear is rumbles
Kanye West samples, here's one for example


Gossip gossip, nigga just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster

And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I'm bout to take it to another level bitch
Matter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple double no assist
And my only focus is staying on some bogus shit
Argue with my older bitch acting like I owe her shit
I heard that people sing raps to give the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fuckin up my money so, yeh, I had to act sane
Chi nigga but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said, "This the number to dial
If you wanna make your number one your number two now
This that goose and malibu, I call it Malibooyah"
Goddamn, Yeezy, how he hit em with the new style
Throw that motherfucker, "Well, whatchu gon' do now?
Whatever ever I wanna do, gosh it's cool now"
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
'Cause you will never get on top of this
So mommy best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
I put the pussy in a sarcophagus
Now she claiming that I bruise her esophagus
Head of the class and she just want a swallowship
I'm living the future so the present is my past
My presence is a present, kiss my ass

Sasquatch, Godzilla, King Kong, Lochness
Goblin, Ghoul, a zombie with no conscience
Question, what do these things all have in common?
Everybody knows I'm a motherfucking monster
Conquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense
Nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is
None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams
Murder murder in black convertibles, I
Kill the block I murder the avenues, I
Rape and pillage a village, women and children
Everybody wanna know what my Achilles heel is?
Love, I don't get enough of it
All I get is these vampires and blood suckers
All I see is these niggas I've made millionnaires
Milling about, spilling there feelings in the air
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
Tryna draw blood from my ice cold veins
I smell a massacre
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up

Pull up in a monster automobile, gangsta
With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka
Yeah I'm in that Tonka color of Willy Wonka
You could be the king but watch the queen conquer
First things first I'll eat your brains
Then I'mma start rocking gold teeth and fangs
'Cause that's what a muthafucking monster do
Hairdresser from Milan, that's the monster 'do
Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and a monster crew
And I'm all up all up all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't
So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50k for a verse, no album out
Yeah my money's so tall that my Barbie's gotta climb it
Hotter than a middle eastern climate, find it
Tony Matterhorn dutty wine it, wine it
Nicki on them titties, when I sign it
That's how these niggas so one-track minded
But really, really I don't give a F-U-C-K
Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki, 'cause she's fake
She's on a diet but my pockets eating cheesecake
And I'll say bride of Chucky is child's play
Just killed another career, it's a mild day
Besides 'Ye, they can't stand besides me
I think me, you and Am should ménage Friday
Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash
I think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
Aaaaahhh, I'm a motherfucking monster


I, I crossed the line, line
And I'll, I'll let God decide, cide
I, I wouldn't last these shows

One hand in the air if you don't really care
Two hands in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes I mean ridiculous
It's like that sometimes this shit ridiculous
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Middle finger in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, man ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous


I'm so appalled, Spalding ball
Balding, Donald Trump taking dollars from y'all
Baby you're fired, your girlfriend hired
And if you don't mind I'mma keep you on call
We above the law, we don't give a fuck 'bout y'all
I got dogs that'll chew a fuckin' hole through the wall
But since they all lovers, I need more rubbers
And if I don't use rubbers, need more covers
Housekeeping, I mean got damn one time
Let it be a bad bitch sweeping
That know we get O's like Cheerios
That know because they seen us in the videos
That know, the day that you play me
Will be the same day MTV played videos
That was a little joke, voila
Praises due to the most high, Allah
Praises due to the most fly, Prada
Baby I'm magic, ta da
Address me as your highness
High as United, thirty thousand feet up and you are not invited
Niggas be writin' bullshit like they gotta work
Niggas is going through real shit, man they outta work
That's why another got damn dance track, gotta hurt
That's why I rather spit something that gotta perk


Champagne wishes, thirty white bitches
I mean this shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous
I mean this shit is fucking ridiculous
(Five star dishes, different exotic fishes
Man this shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous)


How should I begin this, I'm just so offended
How am I even mentioned by all these fucking beginners?
I'm so appalled I might buy the mall
Just to show niggas how much more I have in store
I'm fresher than you all, so I don't have to pause
All of y'all can suck my balls through my drawers
Dark Knight feeling, die and be a hero
Or live long enough to see yourself become a villain
I went from the favorite to the most hated
Or would you rather be underpaid or overrated?
Moral victories is for minor league coaches
And Ye already told you we major, you cockroaches
Show me where the boats is, Ferrari Testarossa's
The Hammer went broke so you know I'm more focused
I lost thirty mill so I spent another thirty
'Cause unlike Hammer thirty million can't hurt me
Fucking insane, the fuck am I sayin'?
Not only am I fly, I'm fucking not playing
All these little bitches too big for their britches
Burning their little bridges, fucking ridiculous

Man this shit is fucking ridiculous

Success is what you make it, take it how it come
A half a mil in twenties like a billion where I'm from
An arrogant drug dealer the legend I've become
CNN said I'd be dead by twenty-one
Blackjack I just pulled in aces
You looking at the king in his face
Everything I dream, motherfuckers, I'm watching it take shape
While to you I'm just a young rich nigga that lacks faith
Range Rove leather roof, love war fuck a truce
Still move a bird like I'm in bed with mother goose
Them hoes coming in a bakers dozen
Claiming they was with me when they know they really wasn't
I keep the city's best, never said she was the brightest
So if you had her too, it don't affect me in the slightest
I never met a bitch that didn't need a little guidance
So I dismiss her past until she disappoints your highness
I speak the gospel, hostile
Tony doing time for what he did to nostrils
Paranoid mind I'm still under the watchful
Eye of the law, aspire for more
Them kilo's came we gave you Bobby Brown jaw
Flaws ain't flaws when it's you that makes the call
Flow similar to the legend of the falls
Spillin' I own you all, yeah


One hand in the air if you don't really care
Two hands in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes I mean ridiculous
It's like that sometimes this shit ridiculous
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Middle finger in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, man ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous


I am so outrageous
I wear my pride on my sleeve like a bracelet
If God had a iPod, I'd be on his playlist
My phrases amazes the faces in places
The favorite, huh, my cup over runneth with hundreds
Dummy, dammit, not like for me to waste it
The new commandment, thou shall not hate kid
My movement is like the civil rights I'm Ralph David
Abernathy, so call my lady Rosa Parks
I am nothing like them niggas baby those are marks
I met this girl on Valentine's Day, fucked her in May
She found out about April so she chose to march
Damn another broken heart
I keep bitches by the twos nigga, Noah's Ark
I got a seven on me, I call my bro Lamar
Plus a Trojan in my pocket, Matt Leinart
G-A-T in the Pathfinder
'Cause you haters got PhDs
Y'all just some major haters and some math minors
Tiger Woods don't make me grab iron


Ayo, champagne wishes and thirty white bitches

Cars for the missus and furs for the mistress
You know that shit is fucking ridiculous

One hand in the air if you don't really care
Middle finger in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, man ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous
I love it though
I love it though

Uh put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my "sin-sation"
I know I'm preaching to the congregation
We love Jesus but you done learned a lot from Satan
I mean a nigga did a lot of waiting
We ain't married but tonight I need some consummation

May the Lord forgive us, may the gods be with us
And that magic hour I seen good Christians
Make rash decisions oh she do it,
What happened to religion? oh she lose it

She putting on her make up, she casually allure
Text message break up, the casualty of tour
How she gone wake up and not love me no more
I thought I was the ass hole, I guess it's rubbing off

Hood phenomenon, the LeBron of rhyme
Hard to be humble when you stuntin on a jumbotron
I'm looking at her like "this what you really wanted, huh?"
What we argue anyway, oh I forgot its summertime

Uh put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my "sin-sation"
I know I'm preaching to the congregation
We love Jesus but you done learned a lot from Satan
I mean a nigga did a lot of waiting
We ain't married but tonight I need some consummation

When the sun go down its the magic hour (The magic hour)
And outta all the colours that are still up the skies
You got green on your mind, I can see it in your eyes

Why you standing there with your face screwed up
Don't leave while your hot that's how Mase screwed up
Throwing shit around, the whole place screwed up
Maybe I should call Mase so that he could pray for us

I hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat
I ordered you jerk, she said "you are what you eat"
You see I always loved your sense of humour
But tonight you should have seen how quiet the room was

The Lyor Cohen or Dior Homme thats
Dior Homme not Dior homie
The crib scarface couldn't be more Tony
You love me for me could you be more phoney

Uh put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my "sin-sation"
Haven't said a word, haven't said a word
To me this evening
Cat got your tongue?


Lookin' at my bitch i bet she give yo ass a bone
Lookin' at my wrist, itta turn yo ass to stone
Stretch limousine, sippin rosé all alone
Double headed monster with a mind of its own

Cherry red chariot excess is just my character
All black tux, nigga shoes lavender
I never needed acceptance from all you outsiders
Had cyphers with yeezy before his mouth wired

Before his jaw shattered climbing up the lord's ladder
We still speeding, running signs like they don't matter
Hater talking never made me mad
Never that not when i'm in my favorite paper tag

Therefore G4s at the Clearport
When it come to tools fool I’m a Pep Boy
When it came to dope I was quick to export
Never tired of ballin’ so it’s on to the next sport

New Mercedes sedan, they’ll export
So many cars DMV thought it was mail fraud
Different traps, I was gettin’ mail from
Polk County, Jacksonville, rep Melbourne

Whole clique appetites had tapeworms
Spinnin’ Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my jay burns
I shed a tear before the night's over
God bless the man I put this ice over

Gettin’ 2Pac money twice over
Still a real nigga, red Coogi sweater, dice roller
I’m makin’ love to the angel of death
Catchin’ feelings never stumble retracin’ my steps
Look at ya, look at ya
Look at ya, look at ya
Look at ya, look at ya
Look at ya, look at ya
Look at ya, look at ya
Look at ya, look at ya
Look at ya, look at ya

Look at ya, look at ya
Look at ya, look at ya
Look at ya, look at ya


Look at ya, look at ya (Ladies and gentlemen)
Look at ya, look at ya
Look at ya, look at ya (Ladies and gentlemen)


And I always find, yeah I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time, for us, to have a toast
Let's have a toast for the douchebags, let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags, every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerkoffs, that'll never take work off
Baby I got a plan, run away fast as you can

She find pictures in my email
I sent this bitch a picture of my dick
I don't know what it is with females
But I'm not too good at that shit
See I could have me a good girl
And still be addicted to them hoodrats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know that's what I'm good at

And I always find, yeah I always find, yeah I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time, for us, to have a toast

24/7, 365, pussy stays on my mind
I, I, I, I did it, all right, alright, I admit it
Now pick your next move, you could leave or live with it
Ichabod Crane with that motherfucking top off
Split and go where? Back to wearing knockoffs, haha
Knock it off, Neiman's, shop it off
Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off
Hoes like vultures, wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
You can't blame 'em, they ain't never seen Versace sofas
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet
Comes with a price tag, baby, face it
You should leave if you can't accept the basics
Plenty hoes in the balla-nigga matrix
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
I'm just young, rich, and tasteless, P


Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know I did damage
'Cause the look in your eyes is killing me
I guess you are at an advantage
'Cause you can blame me for everything
And I don't know how I'mma manage
If one day you just up and leave

And I always find, yeah I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time, for us, to have a toast

So I think it's time for us to have a toast
I think I just fell in love with a porn star
Turn the camera on, she a born star
Turn the corners in a foreign car
Call the coroners, do the CPR
She gave that old nigga a ulcer
Her bittersweet taste made his gold teeth ache
Make her knees shake, make a priest faint
Make a nun cum, make her cremate
Move downtown, cop a sweet space
Livin' life like we won the sweepstakes, what
We headin to hell for heaven's sake, huh
Well I'mma levitate, make the devil wait, yeah

Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think we crossed the line
No more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and baby we'll live a hell of a life

Never in your wildest dreams
Never in your wildest dreams, in your wildest
You could hear the loudest screams
Comin' from inside the screen, you a wild bitch
Tell me what I gotta do to be that guy
Said her price go down, she ever fuck a black guy
Or do anal, or do a gangbang
It's kinda crazy that's all considered the same thing
Well I guess a lotta niggas do gang bang
And if we run trains, we all in the same gang
Runaway slaves all on a chain gang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang

Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think we crossed the line
No more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and baby we'll live a hell of a life

One day I'm gon' marry a porn star
We'll have a big-ass crib and a long yard
We'll have a mansion and some fly maids
Nothin' to hide, we both screwed the bridesmaids
She wanna role play, till I roll over
I'mma need a whole day, at least rolled doja
What party is we goin' to on Oscar day
'Specially if she can't get that dress from Oscar de
La Renta, they wouldn't rent her, they couldn't take the shame
Snatched the dress off her back and told her, “Get away”
How could you say they live they life wrong
When you never fuck with the lights on?

Fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on
Fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on
Fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on
Fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on
Fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on
Fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on

Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think we crossed the line
No more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and baby we'll live a hell of a life

I think I fell in love with a porn star
And got married in a bathroom
Honeymoon on the dance floor
And got divorced by the end of the night
That's one hell of a life
Whose fault?


Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names, for sure

I'll call you bitch for short
As a last resort, and my first result
You call me motherfucker for long
At the end of it you know we both were wrong

But I love to play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call her names, names, I hate you more
Let's call her names, names, for sure


On a bathroom wall I wrote, "I'd rather argue with you than be with someone else"
I took a piss and dismiss it like fuck it and I went and found somebody else
Fuck arguing and harvesting the feelings, yo, I'd rather be by my fucking self
Till about two AM and I call back and I hang up and I start to blame myself
Somebody help


Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names, for sure


You weren't perfect but you made life worth it
Stick around, some real feelings might surface
Been a long time since I spoke to you in a bathroom
Gripping you up, fucking and choking you
What the hell was I supposed to do?
I know you ain't getting this type of dick from that local dude
And if you are I hope you have a good time
'Cause I definitely be having mine

And you ain't finna see a mogul get emotional
Every time I hear bout other niggas is strokin' you
Lying, say I hit you, he sitting there consoling you
Running my name through the mud, who's provoking you?
You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
Now you noticeable and can't nobody get control of you
One AM and can't nobody get a hold of you
I'm calling your brother's phone like what was I supposed to do?
Even though I knew, he never told the truth
He was just gon' say whatever that you told him to
At a certain point I had to stop asking questions
Y'all got dirt on each other like mud wrestlers
I heard he bought some coke with my money
That ain't right girl
You getting blackmailed for that white girl
You always said, "Yeezy, I ain't your right girl
You'll probably find one of them "I like art" type girls"
All of the lights, she-was-caught-in-the-hype girl
And I was satisfied being in love with the lie
Now who to blame, you to blame, me to blame
For the pain and it poured every time when it rained
Let's play the blame game


Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure


"Things used to be, now they not
Anything but us is who we are
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
We've become public enemies
We walk away like strangers in the street
Gone for eternity
We erased one another
So far from where we came
With so much of everything, how do we leave with nothing?
Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of L-O-V-E
Hatred and attitude tear us entirely" - Chloe Mitchell

Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names, for sure

I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much
No, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much

And I know that you are somewhere doing your thing
And when the phone called it just ring and ring
You ain't pick up but your phone accidentally called me back
And I heard the whole thing
I heard the whole thing, whole thing, whole thing, whole thing


Oh my God
Baby you done took this shit to another mother fucking level
Now a neighborhood nigga like me ain't supposed to be gettin' no pussy like this
Goddamn, goddamn
Who taught you how to get sexy for a nigga?
(Yeezy taught me)
You never used to talk dirty, but now you goddamn disgusting
My, my God, where'd, where'd you learn that?

Look at you mother fucking butt ass naked
With them motherfucking Jimmy Choos on

(Yeezy taught me)
Yo you took your pussy game up a whole 'nother level
This is some Cirque du Soleil pussy now, shit
You done went all porno on a nigga, okay? And I, and I love it
And I thank you, I thank you, my dick thanks you!
How did you learn, how'd, how did your pussy game come up?
(Yeezy taught me)
I was fucking parts of your pussy I'd never fucked before
I was in there like, "Oh, shit, I never been here before"
I've never even seen this part of pussy town before
It's like you got this shit re-upholstered or some shit
What the fuck happened?
Who, who the fuck got your pussy all reupholstered?
(Yeezy reupholstered my pussy)
You know what, I got to thank Yeezy
And when I see that nigga, I'mma thank him
I'mma buy the album, I'mma download that motherfucker, I'mma shoot a bootlegger
That's how good I feel about this nigga, oh
I still can't believe you got me this watch
This motherfucker is the exact motherfucker I wanted
Even with the bezel? This is the motherfucker I wanted
I saw this shit, I saw it, Twista had this shit on in the Source
I remember, Twista had this motherfucker on in the Source
That's right, that's right, yo yo babe, yo yo this is the best birthday ever
Where you learn to treat a nigga like this?
(Yeezy taught me)
Yeezy taught you well, Yeezy taught you well
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still to slow down the time
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still to slow down the time
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still to slow down the time

I'm lost in the world, I'm down on my mind
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
Down for the night, said she's down for the night

Down the time
I'm lost in the world, I'm down on my mind
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
Down for the night, said she's down for the night


You're my devil, you're my angel
You're my heaven, you're my hell
You're my now, you're my forever
You're my freedom, you're my jail
You're my lies, you're my truth
You're my war, you're my truce
You're my questions, you're my proof
You're my stress and you're my masseuse
Ma ma se, ma ma se, ma ma ku sa
Lost in this plastic life
Let's break out of this fake-ass party, turn this in to a classic night
If we die in each others arms, still get laid in our afterlife
If we die in each others arms, still get laid, yeah

I’m up in the woods, been down all my life (Run from the lights, run from the night, run for your life)
I’m new in the city, down for the night, down for the night, down for the night
I’m lost in the world, been down my whole life
I’m new in the city, and I’m down for the night
Down for the night, down for the night


Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?

I'm lost in the world, I'm down on my mind
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
Down for the night, said she's down for the night

I'm lost in the world, I'm down on my mind
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
Down for the night, said she's down for the night
Us living as we do upside down. 
And the new word to have is revolution. 
People don't even want to hear the preacher 
spill or spiel because God's whole card has been thoroughly piqued. 
And America is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey. 
The youngsters who were programmed to continue 
fucking up woke up one night digging 
Paul Revere and Nat Turner as the good guys. 
America stripped for bed and we had not all yet closed our eyes.
The signs of Truth were tattooed across our open ended vagina. 
We learned to our amazement untold tale of scandal. 
Two long centuries buried in the musty vault, 
hosed down daily with a gagging perfume. 
America was a bastard the illegitimate daughter of the mother country 
whose legs were then spread around the world 
and a rapist known as freedom, free doom. 
Democracy, liberty, and justice were revolutionary code names 
that preceded the bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling 
in the mother country's crotch
What does Webster say about soul?
All I want is a good home and a wife
and a children and some food to feed them every night.
After all is said and done build a new route to China if they'll have you.
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
