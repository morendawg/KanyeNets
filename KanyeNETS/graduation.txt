Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning

Wake up, Mr. West, Mr. West
Mr. Fresh, Mr. By-Himself-He's-So-Impressed
I mean damn, did you even see the test?
You got D's, motherfucker D's, Rosie Perez
And yer ass barely passed any and every class
Looking at every ass, cheated on every test
I guess this is my dissertation
Homie this shit is basic, welcome to graduation

Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning

Good morning, on this day we become legendary
Everything we dreamed of
I'm like the fly Malcolm X, buy any jeans necessary
Detroit Red cleaned up
From the streets to the league, from a eighth to a key
But you graduate when you make it up outta the streets
From the moments of pain, look how far we done came
Haters saying you changed, now you doing your thang

Good morning
Good morning
Good morniying
Good morning

Good morniying, look at the valedictorian
Scared of the future while I hop in the DeLorean
Scared to face the world, complacent career student
Some people graduate, but be still stupid
They tell you read this, eat this, don't look around
Just peep this, preachers, teach us, Jesus
Okay look up now, they done stoled yo' streetness
After all of that you received this


Good morning
(Hustlers, that's if you're still livin', get on down)
Every time that we hear them, good morning
(Hustlers, that's if you're still livin', get on down)
Every time that we hear them, good morning
(Hustlers, that's if you're still livin', get on down)
Every time that we hear them, good morning
(Hustlers, that's if you're still livin', get on down)


Get on down
Get, get on down
Get on down
Get, get on down
Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?


Yes I did, so I packed it up and brought it back to the crib
Just a little somethin', show you how we live
Everybody want it but it ain't that serious
Mmm hmm, that's that shit
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this


Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?


You don't see just how wild the crowd is?
You don't see just how fly my style is?
I don't see why I need a stylist
When I shop so much I can speak Italian
I don't know I just want it better for my kids
And I ain't sayin' we was from the projects
But every time I wanted, layaway or a deposit
My daddy'd say, "When you see clothes, close your eyelids"
We was sort of like Will Smith and his son
In the movie, I ain't talkin' 'bout the rich ones
'Cause every summer he'd get some
Brand new hare-brained scheme to get rich from
And I don't know what he did for dough
But he'd send me back to school wit' a new wardrobe


(And hey, hey, hey, hey)
Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?


I think he did, when he packed it up and brought it back to the crib
Just a little somethin' show you how we lived
Everything I wanted man it seemed so serious
Mmm hmm, that's that shit
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this


Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?


When it feel like living's harder than dying
For me giving up's way harder than trying
Lauryn Hill said her heart was in Zion
I wish her heart still was in rhyming
'Cause who the kids gon' listen to, huh?
I guess me if it isn't you
Last week, I paid a visit to the institute
They got the dropout keeping kids in the school
I guess I cleaned up my act like Prince'd do
If not for pleasure, then at least for the principle
They got the CD, they got to see me
Drop gems like I dropped out of PE
They used to feel invisible
Now they know they invincible


(Hey, hey, hey)
Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?


This is the story of a champion
Runners on your mark and they pop the guns
Stand up, stand up, here he comes
Tell me what it takes to be number one
Tell me what it takes to be number one
This is the story of a champion
Runners on your mark and they pop the guns
Stand up, stand up, here he comes
Tell me what it takes to be number one
Tell me what it takes to be number one


Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?


Yes I did, so I packed it up and brought it back to the crib
Just a little somethin' show you how we live
Everybody want it but it ain't that serious
Mmm hmm, that's that shit
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this


Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?
Find your dreams come true
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams


I've been waiting on this my whole life
These dreams be waking me up at night
You say I think I'm never wrong
You know what, maybe you're right, aight


And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams


You say he get on your fucking nerves
You hope that he get what he deserves, word
Do you even remember what the issue is?
You just trying to find where the tissue is
You can still be who you wish you is
It ain't happen yet
And that's what intuition is
When you hop back in the car
Drive back to the crib
Run back to their arms
The smokescreens
The chokes and the screams
You ever wonder what it all really means?


And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams


And I'm back on my grind
A psychic read my lifeline
Told me in my lifetime
My name would help light up the Chicago skyline
And that's why I'm
Seven o'clock, that's primetime
Heaven'll watch, God calling from the hotlines
Why he keep giving me hot lines?
I'm a star, how could I not shine?
How many ladies in the house?
How many ladies in the house without a spouse?
Something in your blouse got me feeling so aroused
What you about?
On that independent shit
Trade it all for a husband and some kids
You ever wonder what it all really mean?
You wonder if you'll ever find your dreams?
Like we always do at this time
I go for mine, I gots to shine
(Now throw yo' hands up in the sky)
I go, go for mine, I gots to shine
(Now throw yo' hands up in the sky
I'mma get on the TV momma, I'mma

Ay, (Ay), Ay, (Ay)
Ay, (Ay), Ay, (I'm good)

Welcome to the good life, where niggas who sell D
Won't even get pulled over in they new V
The good life, let's go on a living spree
Shit, they say the best things in life are free
The good life, it feel like Atlanta
It feel like L.A., it feel like Miami
It feel like N.Y., summertime Chi
Ahh (Now throw yo' hands up in the sky)
So I roll through good, y'all pop the trunk
I pop the hood, Ferrari
And she got the goods, and she got that ass
I got to look, sorry
Yo, it's got to be 'cause I'm seasoned
Haters give me them salty looks, Lawry's
50 told me, go 'head, switch the style up
And if they hate then let 'em hate
And watch the money pile up, the good life

Now I, I go for mine, I got to shine
(Now throw yo' hands up in the sky)
Now I, I go for mine, I got to shine

Ay, (Ay), Ay, (Ay)
Ay, (Ay), Ay, (I'm good)

Welcome to the good life
Where we like the girls who ain't on TV
'Cause they got mo' ass than the models
The good life, so keep it comin' with the bottles
'Cause she feel booze like she bombed at Apollo
The good life, it feel like Houston
It feel like Philly, it feel like DC
It feel like VA or the Bay or Yay
Ay, this is the good life (Welcome to the good life)
Homey, tell me what's good
Why I only got a problem when you in the hood? (Welcome to the good life)
Like I'm new in the hood
The only thing I wish, I wish a nigga would (Welcome to the good life)
He probably think he could
But, but, I don't think he should (Welcome to the good life)
50 told me, "Go 'head, switch the style up
And if they hate then let 'em hate
And watch the money pile up, the good life"

Now I, I go for mine, I got to shine
(Now throw yo' hands up in the sky)
Now I, I go for mine, I got to shine

I'mma get on this TV momma, I'mma
I'mma put shit down)
Ay, (Ay), Ay, (Ay)
Ay, (Ay), Ay, (I'm good)

Have you ever popped champagne on a plane
While gettin' some brain?
Whipped it out, she said, "I never seen Snakes on a Plane"
Whether you broke or rich you gotta get this
Havin' money's not everything not havin' it is
I was splurgin' on Tryst, but when I get my card back
Activated, I'm back to Vegas
'Cause (The good life) I always had a passion for flashin'
Before I had it, I closed my eyes and imagined the good life


Better than the life I lived
When I thought that I was gonna go crazy
And now my grandmama
Ain't the only girl callin' me, "Baby"
If you feelin' me now
Then put yo' hands up in the sky, and let me hear you say
Hey, hey, ooh I'm good
It's what you all been waiting for ain't it?
What people pay paper for damn it, they can't stand it
They want something new, so let's get reacquainted
Became the hood favorite, I can't even explain it, I surprise myself too
Life of a Don, lights keep glowing
Coming in the club with that fresh shit on
With something crazy on my arm
Uh-uh-hum, and here's another hit, Barry Bonds

We outta here baby
We outta here baby
We outta here baby

Dude, fresh off the plane, konichiwa bitches
Turn around another plane, my passport on pivot
Ask for it I did it, that asshole done did it
Talked it then he lived it, spit it then he shit it
I don't need writers, I might bounce ideas
But only I could come up with some shit like this
I done played the underdog my whole career
I've been a very good sport, haven't I, this year
They say, "He going crazy and we seen this before"
But I'm doing pretty good as far as geniuses go
And I'm doing pretty hood in my pink polo
Nigga please, how you gonna say I ain't no Lo-head
'Cause my Dior got me more model head
I'm insulted, you should go 'head
And bow so hard until your knees hit your forehead
And the flow just hit code red
Top 5 MCs, you ain't gotta remind me
Top 5 MCs, you gotta rewind me
I'm high up on the line, you could get behind me
But my head's so big you can't sit behind me
Life of a Don, lights keep glowing
Coming in the club with that fresh shit on
With something crazy on my arm
Uh-uh-hum, and here's another hit, Barry Bonds


Yeah, yeah, we outta here baby
Wha, wha, we outta here baby
Hey Mr. West, we so outta here baby

And me, I'm Mr. Weezy Baby
Yeah, I'm so bright not shady
My teeth and my ice so white like Shady
Ice in my teeth so refrigerated
I'm so fucking good like I'm sleeping with Megan
I'm all about my Franklins, Lincolns and Reagans
Whenever they make them, I shall hayve them
Oops, I meant have them, I'm so crazy
But if you play crazy you be sleeping with daisies
I'm such a hay-vic, oops I meant havoc
And my drink's still pinker than the Easter rabbit
And I'm still cole like Keyshia's family
Stove on my waist turn beef to patties
And I ate it cause I'm so avid
I don't front and I don't go backwards
And I don't practice and I don't lack shit
And you can get buried, suck my bat bitch


We outta here baby
We outta here baby
We outta here baby


Swag at a hundred and climbin', baby, yeah
Life of a Don, lights keep glowing
Coming in the club with that fresh shit on
With something crazy on my arm
Ha ha hum, and here's another hit, Barry Bonds

Love the dangerous necessity that people seek without regard
To where they are, the human heart is curious, above all things
Love, the lights are low, your eyes are bright
The music plays, it's sweet delight
It's out of sight, I'm feeling right, your dress is tight
Oh how I want you right now

Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights


She don't believe in shooting stars
But she believe in shoes and cars
Wood floors in the new apartment
Couture from the store's departments
You more like, "I love to start shit"
I'm more of the trips to Florida
Ordered the hors d'oeuvres, views of the water
Straight from a page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy
Man, why can't life always be this easy?
She in the mirror dancing so sleazy
I get a call like, "Where are you Yeezy?"
And try to hit you with the ol-wu-wopte
Till I got flashed by the paparazzi
Damn, these niggas got me
I hate these niggas more than a Nazi


As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
But what do I know? (Flashing lights, lights)
What do I know? (Flashing lights, lights)


I know it's been a while sweetheart, we hardly talk, I was doing my thang
I know it was foul, baby, aye babe, lately, you've been all on my brain
And if somebody woulda told me a month ago, fronting though, yo, I wouldn't wanna know
If somebody woulda told me a year ago, it'll go get this difficult
Feeling like Katrina with no F.E.M.A., like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no visa, first class with the seat back, I still see ya
In my past, you on the other side of the glass of my memory's museum
I'm just saying, hey Mona Lisa come home, you know you can't roam without Caesar


As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
But what do I know? (Flashing lights, lights)
What do I know? (Flashing lights, lights)

As you recall, you know I love to show off
But you never thought that I would take it this far
But what do you know? (Flashing lights, lights)
What do you know? (Flashing lights, lights)


Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights

Lights, lights, lights, lights
Lights, lights, lights, lights
Lights, lights, lights, lights
Lights, lights, lights, lights
Lights, lights, lights, lights

Lights, lights, lights, lights
Damn, here we go again
Common passed on this beat, I made it to a jam
Now everything I'm not made me everything I am
Damn, here we go again
People talking shit but when shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am


I'll never be picture perfect Beyoncé
Be light as Al B. or black as Chauncey
Remember him from Blackstreet, he was as black as the street was
I never be laid back as this beat was
I never could see why people reach a
Fake ass facade that they couldn't keep up
You see how I creeped up
You see how I played the big role in "Chicago" like Queen Latifah
I never rock a mink coat in the wintertime like Killa Cam
Or rock some mink boots in the summertime like Will.I.Am
Let me know if you feel it man
'Cause everything I'm not made me everything I am


Damn, here we go again
Everybody saying what's not for him
But everything I'm not, made me everything I am
Damn, here we go again
People talking shit but when shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am


And I'm back to tear it up
Haters start your engines, I hear 'em gearing up
People talk so much shit about me at barbershops
They forget to get their hair cut
Okay, fair enough, the streets is flaring up
'Cause they want gun-talk, or I don't wear enough
Baggy clothes, Reeboks, or Adidos
Can I add that he do spaz out at his shows?
So say goodbye to the N-double A-CP award
Goodbye to the India Arie award
They'd rather give me the ni-nigga-please award
But I'll just take the I-got-alotta-cheese award


Damn, here we go again
But everything I'm not made me everything I am
Damn, here we go again
People talking shit but when shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am


I know that people wouldn't usually rap this
But I got the facts to back this
Just last year, Chicago had over six hundred caskets
Man, killing's some wack shit
Oh, I forgot, 'cept for when niggas is rappin'
Do you know what it feel like when people is passin'?
He got changed over his chains, a block off Ashland
I need to talk to somebody, pastor
The church want tithe, so I can't afford to pay
Pink slip on my door 'cause I can't afford to stay
My fifteen seconds up, but I got more to say
"That's enough Mr. West, please, no more today"


Damn, here we go again
Everybody saying what's not for him
But everything I'm not made me everything I am
Damn, here we go again
People talking shit but when shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am


Here we go, here, here we go
Here we go, here, here we go
Here we go, we, we, we
We go, we go, we go, we go, we go
Go go go again


Yeah baby
In my soul, gonna take you to the glory
Goal, in my mind I can't study war, no, no
I can't study war, no, no
I can't study war, no, no (Yeah)
I can't study war, no, no (Uh, now where the south side?)
I can't study war, no, no (Uh)
I can't study war, no, no (Uh, uh)
I can't study war, no, no (Now where the west side?)
I can't study war, no, no (Yep)
I can't study war, no, no (Uh)


Can I talk my shit again even if I don't hit again?
Dog, are you fucking kidding? My hat, my shoes, my coat
Louis Vuitton stitch, with Donatella Versace
That's Louis Vuitton bitch
I think Hennessy, I drank, I'm gone
Off that Bacardi Limon and Corona, I'm zoning
Class back in session so I upped it a grade
Two years Dwayne Wayne became Dwyane Wade
And, hey, please don't start me
I'm like Gnarls Barkley meets Charles Barkley
I'm pop the Barkers, I'm hood the Parkers
While y'all was in limbo, I raised the bar up
I touched on everything
Married to the game, roc-a-chain 'stead of a wedding ring
Y'all bridesmaids catch the garter
On nights when Ye romance, cameras flash so much
That I gotta do that Yayo dance
I'm on a world tour with Common, my man
After each and every show a couple dykes in the van
It's easy, the hood love to listen to Jeezy and Weezy
And, oh yeah, Yeezy, I did it for the glory


I can't study war, no, no
I can't study war, no, no (The glory)
I can't study war, no, no
I can't study war, no, no (I did it for the glory)
I can't study war, no, no
I can't study war, no, no (The glory)
I can't study war, no, no
I can't study war, no, no (Uh)


What am I supposed to do now? Man, the game all messed up
How I'm suppose to stand out when everybody get dressed up?
So yeah, at the Grammys I went ultra Travolta
Yeah, that tuxedo might have been a little guido
But with my ego, I can stand there in a speedo
And be looked at like a fucking hero
The glory, the story, the chain, the polo, the night
The grind, the empty bottles of No-Doz
Tank on empty, whipping my mama Volvo
I spent that gas money on clothes with logos
The fur is Hermes, shit that you don't floss
The Goyard so hard man, I'm Hugo's boss
Why I gotta ask what that Tudor cost
House on the hill, two doors from Tracey Ross
And I'm asking about her girlfriends, yeah, the dark skinned ones
She asking about the speed boats yeah I admit we rented 'em
When you meet me in person what do you feel like?
I know, I know I look better in real life
I hear people compare themselves to big a lot
You know B.I.G. and Pac, you know to get it hot
I guess after I live I wanna be compared to B.I.G.
Anyone, Big Pun, Big L, or Notorious
Till then, get money and stunt and stay glorious
And I'm gonna stop killing these niggas soon as the chorus hit


(I can't study war, no, no)
Yeah I'mma stop killin' these niggas soon as the chorus hit 
(I can't study war, no, no)
Uh, these haters be killing theyself they wanna come and get the glory 


I can't study war, no, no
I can't study war, no, no (Uh)
I can't study war, no, no (The glory)
I can't study war, no, no (Uh huh, now where the south side?)
I can't study war, no, no (Yeah)
I can't study war, no, no (Now where the west side?)
I can't study war, no, no (Yeah)


I can't study war, no, no
I can't study war, no, no
I can't study war, no, no
I can't study war, no, no
Yeah
And you say Chi-City?
Chi-City, Chi-City


I'm coming home again
Do you think about me now and then? (Yeah)
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm coming home again
I'm in home again (Ow)


I met this girl when I was 3 years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She said "Excuse me lil homey, I know you don't know me
But, my name is Windy and I like to blow trees"
And from that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off
And make 'em straighten up their hat cause she know they soft
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime her face lit up, so astounding
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never messed with entertainers cause they always leave
She said it felt like they walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said, "'Ye, keep making that keep making that platinum and gold for me"


I'm coming home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm coming home again
I'm in home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then? Oh
Now I'm coming home again
Maybe we could start again


But if you really cared for her
Then you wouldn't have never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her, but when I talk to her
It always seems like she talking 'bout me
She said, "You left your kids, and they just like you
They want to rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you" and I just got through
Talking 'bout what we tryna do: just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
Every interview I'm representing you, making you proud
Reach for the stars so if you fall, you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around
If you don't know by now, I'm talking 'bout Chi-Town


I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again
I'm in home again
Maybe, do you remember when
Fireworks at Lake Michigan, oh
Now I'm coming home again
I'm in home again
Maybe you, do you remember when?
Fireworks at Lake Michigan, oh
Now I'm comin' home again
Maybe we can start again

Loyee oyeee oh, loyee oyeee oh
I'm in home again
Loyee oyeee oh, loyee oyeee oh
I'm in home again
Maybe we can start again
e gon' be there" but
Not only did I not get a chance to spit it
Carline told me I could buy two tickets
I guess big brother was thinkin' a little different
And kept little brother at bay, at a distance
But everything that I felt was more bogus
Only made me more focused, only wrote more potent
Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over
I guess I'll understand when I get more older
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
Now I'm on the top and everybody on the scrotum

My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin, begin
Let the story begin
If you feel the way I feel, why don't you wave your hands?

Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant?
Not only a client, the Presidito, hola, Hovito
The game gettin' foul so here's a free throw
I was always on the other side of the peephole
Then I dropped Jesus Walks now I'm on the steeple
And we know New Jack City got to keep my brother
But to be number one I'mma beat my brother
On that Diamonds remix I swore I spazzed
Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
Sibling rivalry, only I could see
It was the pride in me that was drivin' me
At the Grammys, I said, "I inspired me"
But my big brother who I always tried to be
When I kicked a flow it like pick-and-roll
'Cause even if he gave me the rock, it's give-and-go
I guess Beanie's style was more of a slam dunk
But my shit was more like a finger roll
But I had them singles though
And them hoes at the show gonna mingle, yo, heh, y'all know
I told Jay I did a song with Coldplay
Next thing I know he got a song with Coldplay
Back in my mind I'm like "Damn, no way"
Translate español, "No way, Jose"
Then I went and told Jay Brown
Shoulda known that was gonna come back around
Shoulda talked to you like a man, shoulda told you first
But I told somebody else and that's what made shit worse

My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
So here's a few words from ya kid brother
If you admire somebody you should go on 'head tell 'em
People never get the flowers while they can still smell 'em
A idol in my eyes, god of the game
Heart of the City, Roc-a-Fella chain
Never be the same, never be another
Number one, Young Hov, also my big brother

My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D., my mentor, and that's where the story ends

Toomp killed this shit
Bittersweet
You're gonna be the death of me
I don't want you but I need you
I love you and hate you at the very same time
Bittersweet

See what I want so much, should never hurt this bad
Never did this before, that's what the virgin says
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says
God talk to me now, this is an emergency

And she claim she only wit' me for the currency
You cut me deep, bitch, cut me like surgery
And I was too proud to admit that it was hurtin' me
I'd never do that to you, at least purposely

We breakin' up again
We makin' up again
But we don't love no more
I guess we fuckin' then

Have you ever felt you ever want to kill her?
And you mix them emotions with tequilla
And you mix that wit' a little bad advice
On one of them bad nights, y'all have a bad fight
And you talkin' 'bout her family, her aunts and shit
And she say, muhfucka, yo mama's a bitch

You know, domestic drama and shit, all the attitude
I'll never hit a girl, but I'll shake the shit outta you
But I'ma be the bigger man, big pimpin' like jigga man
Oh, I guess I figure it's

Bittersweet
You're gonna be the death of me
I don't want you but I need you
I love you and hate you at the very same time
Bittersweet

See what I want so much, should never hurt this bad
Never did this before, that's what the virgin says
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says
God talk to me now, this is an emergency

And my nigga said I shouldn't let it worry me
I need to focus on the girls we gettin' currently
But I've been thinkin' and it got me back to sinkin' in
This relationship, it even got me back to drinkin'

Now this Hennessey, is gonna' be the death of me
And I always thought that you havin' my child was our destiny
But I can't even vibe wit you sexually
'Cause every time that I try you will question me.

Saying, you fuckin' them girls, disrespecting me
You don't see how your lies is affectin' me
You don't see how our life was supposed to be
And I never let a nigga get that close to me

And you ain't cracked up
To what you was supposed to be
You always gone, you always be where them hoes will be
And it's the first time she ever spilled her soul to me

Bittersweet
(I fucked up and I know it, G)
You're gonna be the death of me
(I guess it's bittersweet poetry)
I don't want you but I need you
I love you and hate you at the very same time

Bittersweet
You're gonna be the death of me
I don't want you but I need you
I love you and hate you at the very same time

See what I want so much, should never hurt this bad
Never did this before, that's what the virgin says
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says
God talk to me now, this is an emergency

See what I want so much, should never hurt this bad
Never did this before, that's what the virgin says
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says
God  talk to me now, this is an emergency

Bittersweet
You're gonna be the death of me
I don't want you but I need you
I love you and hate you at the very same time
(Bridge - Mos Def)
I'm not sure anymore-more
Who is knocking at my door-door
All the faces that I know
You make them sunny and new

(Chorus - Mos Def)
I don't wanna say goodbye to you
So I'll just say good night to you
My people, no goodbyes to you
I'm just gonna say good night

(Verse - Kanye West)
Right now I can see it so vivid
Like it was just yesterday like I could relive it
Me and my grandparents on a field trid-ip
And I'm the little kid tryna touch the exhibits
But it'll fade before I get to get a hold of that
Man I wish I could stop time like a photograph
Every joke that they told I'd know to laugh
Man, man I wouldn't let a moment pass
What do it mean when you dream that you fallin'
What do it mean when you dream that you ballin'
What do it mean when you never dream at all then
And you don't really know cause you can't recall them
It's sorta fly you get a chance to say hi to
People you never got a chance to say bye to
Maybe you could pull em up outta your dreams
Into real life, if you try to
So close, but so far
And so far, no cigar
We can't dwell on the day PAST all we got is today

So I'mma live like there's no tomorrow
No goodbye

(Chorus - Mos Def)
I don't wanna say goodbye to you
So I'll just say good night to you
My people, no goodbyes to you
I'm just gonna say good night

(Verse - Al Be)
Uhh, to you
If I part my art will live through you
Dream beautiful and unusual
Wake up like everyday new to you
Stay true to you, a hood musical
My art will live through you
Dream beautiful and unusual
Wake up like everyday new to you
Stay true to you, a hood musical

(Chorus - Mos Def)
I don't wanna say goodbye to you
So I'll just say good night to you
My people, no goodbyes to you
I'm just gonna say good night

(Bridge - Mos Def) x3
I'm not sure anymore-more
Who is knocking at my door-door
All the faces that I know
You make them sunny and new
Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights


She don't believe in shooting stars
But she believe in shoes and cars
Wood floors in the new apartment
Couture from the store's departments
You more like, "I love to start shit"
I'm more of the trips to Florida
Ordered the hors d'oeuvres, views of the water
Straight from a page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy
Man, why can't life always be this easy?
She in the mirror dancing so sleazy
I get a call like, "Where are you Yeezy?"
And try to hit you with the ol-wu-wopte
Till I got flashed by the paparazzi
Damn, these niggas got me
I hate these niggas more than a Nazi


As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
But what do I know? (Flashing lights, lights)
What do I know? (Flashing lights, lights)


I know it's been a while sweetheart, we hardly talk, I was doing my thang
I know it was foul, baby, aye babe, lately, you've been all on my brain
And if somebody woulda told me a month ago, fronting though, yo, I wouldn't wanna know
If somebody woulda told me a year ago, it'll go get this difficult
Feeling like Katrina with no F.E.M.A., like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no visa, first class with the seat back, I still see ya
In my past, you on the other side of the glass of my memory's museum
I'm just saying, hey Mona Lisa come home, you know you can't roam without Caesar


As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
But what do I know? (Flashing lights, lights)
What do I know? (Flashing lights, lights)

As you recall, you know I love to show off
But you never thought that I would take it this far
But what do you know? (Flashing lights, lights)
What do you know? (Flashing lights, lights)


Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights

Lights, lights, lights, lights
Lights, lights, lights, lights
Lights, lights, lights, lights
Lights, lights, lights, lights
Lights, lights, lights, lights

Lights, lights, lights, lights
Like we always do at this time
I go for mine, I gots to shine
(Now throw yo' hands up in the sky)
I go, go for mine, I gots to shine
(Now throw yo' hands up in the sky
I'mma get on the TV momma, I'mma
I'mma put shit down)
Ay, (Ay), Ay, (Ay)
Ay, (Ay), Ay, (I'm good)

Welcome to the good life, where niggas who sell D
Won't even get pulled over in they new V
The good life, let's go on a living spree
Shit, they say the best things in life are free
The good life, it feel like Atlanta
It feel like L.A., it feel like Miami
It feel like N.Y., summertime Chi
Ahh (Now throw yo' hands up in the sky)
So I roll through good, y'all pop the trunk
I pop the hood, Ferrari
And she got the goods, and she got that ass
I got to look, sorry
Yo, it's got to be 'cause I'm seasoned
Haters give me them salty looks, Lawry's
50 told me, go 'head, switch the style up
And if they hate then let 'em hate
And watch the money pile up, the good life

Now I, I go for mine, I got to shine
(Now throw yo' hands up in the sky)
Now I, I go for mine, I got to shine
(Now throw yo' hands up in the sky
I'mma get on this TV momma, I'mma
I'mma put shit down)
Ay, (Ay), Ay, (Ay)
Ay, (Ay), Ay, (I'm good)

Welcome to the good life
Where we like the girls who ain't on TV
'Cause they got mo' ass than the models
The good life, so keep it comin' with the bottles
'Cause she feel booze like she bombed at Apollo
The good life, it feel like Houston
It feel like Philly, it feel like DC
It feel like VA or the Bay or Yay
Ay, this is the good life (Welcome to the good life)
Homey, tell me what's good
Why I only got a problem when you in the hood? (Welcome to the good life)
Like I'm new in the hood
The only thing I wish, I wish a nigga would (Welcome to the good life)
He probably think he could
But, but, I don't think he should (Welcome to the good life)
50 told me, "Go 'head, switch the style up
And if they hate then let 'em hate
And watch the money pile up, the good life"

Now I, I go for mine, I got to shine
(Now throw yo' hands up in the sky)
Now I, I go for mine, I got to shine
(Now throw yo' hands up in the sky
I'mma get on this TV momma, I'mma
I'mma put shit down)
Ay, (Ay), Ay, (Ay)
Ay, (Ay), Ay, (I'm good)

Have you ever popped champagne on a plane
While gettin' some brain?
Whipped it out, she said, "I never seen Snakes on a Plane"
Whether you broke or rich you gotta get this
Havin' money's not everything not havin' it is
I was splurgin' on Tryst, but when I get my card back
Activated, I'm back to Vegas
'Cause (The good life) I always had a passion for flashin'
Before I had it, I closed my eyes and imagined the good life


Better than the life I lived
When I thought that I was gonna go crazy
And now my grandmama
Ain't the only girl callin' me, "Baby"
If you feelin' me now
Then put yo' hands up in the sky, and let me hear you say
Hey, hey, ooh I'm good
