Why would she make calls out the blue?
Now I'm awake, sleepless in you

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will unless you will
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will then play you will
I pray you will

Mrs. So Fly crash lands in my room
Can't waste no time, she might leave soon

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will
One day you will, I pray you will

When I grab your neck, I touch your soul
Take off your cool, then lose control

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will
You will, you will
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will if you will
I pray you will

I wish this song would really come true
I admit, I still fantasize about you, about you

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don' say you will
You will, you will
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Please say you will for real
I pray you will
My friend showed me pictures of his kids
And all I could show him was pictures of my cribs
He said his daughter got a brand new report card, card
And all I got was a brand new sports car, oh


And my head keeps spinning
Can't stop having these visions, I gotta get with it
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
And my head keeps spinning
I can't stop having these visions, I gotta get with it
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)


Dad cracked a joke, all the kids laughed
But I couldn't hear him all the way in first class
Chased the good life my whole life long
Look back on my life and my life gone
Where did I go wrong?


And my head keeps spinning
Can't stop having these visions, I gotta get with it
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
And my head keeps spinning
I can't stop having these visions, I gotta get with it
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)


I've seen it, I've seen it before
I've seen it, I've seen it before
I've seen it, I've seen it before
I've seen it, I've seen it before

My god-sister getting married by the lake
But I couldn't figure out who I'd wanna take
Bad enough that I showed up late
I had to leave before they even cut the cake
Welcome to heartbreak


And my head keeps spinning
Can't stop having these visions, I gotta get with it
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
And my head keeps spinning
I can't stop having these visions, I gotta get with it
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)


Ooh
