Yeezy season approaching
Fuck whatever y'all been hearing
Fuck what, fuck whatever y'all been wearing
The monster about to come alive again

Soon as I pull up and park the Benz
We get this bitch shaking like Parkinsons
Take my number and lock it in
Indian hair, no moccasins

It's too many hoes in this house of sin
Real nigga back in the house again
Black Timbs all on your couch again
Black dick all in your spouse again
And I know she like chocolate men
She got more niggas off than , huh

On sight
On sight

How much you wanna give a fuck?
Let me show you right now before you give it up
How much do I not give a fuck?
Let me show you right now before you give it up



Baby girl tryna get a nut
And her girl tryna give it up
Chopped 'em both down
Don't judge 'em, 

One last announcement
No sports bra, lets keep it bouncin'
Everybody wanna live at the top of the mountain
Took her to The Bleau she tried to sip the fountain
That when David Grutman kicked her out
But I got her back in and put my dick in her mouth

On sight
On sight
Uh
Uh-huh
Uh-huh

Right now
I need, right now
I need, I need, right now
Right now
I need, I need, right now
For my theme song (Black), my leather black jeans on (Black)
My by-any-means on, pardon, I'm getting my scream on (Black)
Enter the kingdom (Black) but watch who you bring home
They see a black man with a white woman, at the top floor they gone come to kill King Kong
Middle America packed in (Black) came to see me in my black skin (Black)
Number one question they're askin', fuck every question you askin' (Black)
If I don't get ran out by Catholics (Black), here come some conservative Baptists
Claiming I'm overreactin' like them black kids in Chiraq bitch

Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it

So follow me up 'cause this shit 'bout to go down
I'm doing 500, I'm outta control now
But there's nowhere to go now
And there's no way to slow down
If I knew what I knew in the past
I would've been blacked out on your ass

Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen

Black out the room, bitch (Black) stop all that coon shit (Black)
These niggas ain't doin' shit (Black), them niggas ain't doin' shit
Come on homie what happened? You niggas ain't breathin', you gaspin'
These niggas ain't ready for action, action, ready, ready for action, action

Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
I think I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300 like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?

I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it

So follow me up 'cause this shit 'bout to go down

Even though I'm a man of God
My whole life in the hand of God
So y'all better quit playin' with God

Soon as they like you make 'em unlike you
'Cause kissin' people ass is so unlike you
The only rapper compared to Michael
So here's a few hatin'-ass niggas to fight you
And here's a few snake-ass niggas to bite you
And I don't even wanna hear 'bout what niggas might do
Old niggas mentally still in high school
Since the tight jeans they ain't never liked you
Pink-ass polos with a fuckin' backpack
But everybody know you brought real rap back
Nobody had swag, man, we the Rat Pack
Virgil, Pyrex, Don C snapback
Ibn diamond, Chi-town shinin'
Monop' in this bitch again, changed the climate
Hop in this bitch again, same thing I'm in
Until the day I get struck by lightning

I am a god
So hurry up with my damn massage
In a French-ass restaurant
Hurry up with my damn croissants

I am a god
I am a god

Ahh

Ahh

Ain't no way I'm givin' up

My mama was raised in the era when
Clean water was only served to the fairer skin
Doing clothes you would have thought I had help
But they wasn't satisfied unless I picked the cotton myself
You see it's broke nigga racism, that's that "Don't touch anything in the store"
And this rich nigga racism, that's that "Come in, please buy more
What you want, a Bentley? Fur coat? A diamond chain?
All you blacks want all the same things"
Used to only be niggas now everybody playing
Spending everything on Alexander Wang, new slaves

You see it's leaders and it's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower
You see it's leaders and it's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower

I throw these Maybach keys, I wear my heart on the sleeve
I know that we the new slaves, I see the blood on the leaves
I see the blood on the leaves, I see the blood on the leaves
I know that we the new slaves, I see the blood on the leaves
They throwing hate at me, want me to stay at ease
Fuck you and your corporation, y'all niggas can't control me
I know that we the new slaves, I know that we the new slaves
I'm 'bout to wild the fuck out, I'm going Bobby Boucher
I know that pussy ain't free, you niggas pussy, ain't me
Y'all throwing contracts at me, you know that niggas can't read
Throw 'em some Maybach keys, fuck it, c'est la vie
I know that we the new slaves, y'all niggas can't fuck with me
Y'all niggas can't fuck with Ye, y'all niggas can't fuck with Ye
I'll move my family out the country, so you can't see where I stay
So go and grab the reporters, so I can smash their recorders
See they'll confuse us with some bullshit like the New World Order
Meanwhile the DEA, teamed up with the CCA
They tryna lock niggas up, they tryna make new state
See that's that privately owned prison, get your piece today
They prolly all in the Hamptons, bragging 'bout what they made
Fuck you and your Hampton house, I'll fuck your Hampton spouse
Came on her Hampton blouse and in her Hampton mouth
Y'all 'bout to turn shit up, I'm 'bout to tear shit down
I'm 'bout to air shit out, now what the fuck they gon' say now?

I won't end this high, not this time again
So long, so long, so long, you cannot survive
And I'm not dyin', and I can't lose
I can't lose, no, I can't lose
'Cause I can't leave it to you
So let's get too high, get too high again


Too high again, too high
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Too high, yeah


Egyszer a nap úgy elfáradt
Elaludt mély zöld tó ölén
Az embereknek fájt a sötét
Ő megsajnált, eljött közénk
Igen
I can hold my liquor
But this man can’t handle his weed
Dark and lonely now
On Chicago, south of town
I'm on to Indiana
I heard it in the radio now


I can't handle no liquor
But these bitches can't handle me
I can't control my niggas
And my niggas they can't control me
You say you know me, my nigga
But you really just know the old me


Bitch, I'm back out my coma
Wakin' up on your sofa
When I park my Range Rover
Slightly scratch your Corolla
Okay, I smashed your Corolla
I'm hangin' on a hangover
Five years we been over
Ask me why I came over
One more hit and I can own ya
One more fuck and I can own ya
One cold night in October
Pussy had me floatin'
Feel like Deepak Chopra
Pussy had me dead
Might call 2Pac over
Yeezy's all on your sofa
These the Red Octobers
Still ain't learn me no manners
You love me when I ain't sober
You love me when I'm hungover
Even when I blow doja
Then her auntie came over
Skinny bitch with no shoulders
Tellin' you that I'm bogus
Bitch you don't even know us
"Baby girl, he's a loner
Baby girl, he's a loner
Late-night organ donor
After that, he disown ya
After that he's just hopeless
Soul mates become soulless
When it's over it's over"
And bitch, I'm back out my coma


Callin' up your uncle's place
Shit's all over the place
I don't hear your phone
Oh, I wanna phone home


I can't handle no liquor
But these bitches can't handle me
I can't control my niggas
And my niggas they can't control me
You say you know me, my nigga
But you really just know the old me


I heard you need a new fad (A new girl)
I heard you need a new stack (A new girl)
I heard you need a new phone (A new girl)
I know your 'rents ain't be home (A new girl)


Callin' up your uncle's place
Shit's all over the place
I don't hear your phone
Oh, I wanna phone home
Damn your lips very soft
As I turn my Blackberry off
And I turn your bathwater on
And you turn off your iPhone
Careless whispers, eye fuckin', bitin' ass
Neck, ears, hair, legs, eating ass
Your pussy's too good, I need to crash
Your titties, let 'em out, free at last
Thank God almighty, they free at last
We was up at the party but we was leavin' fast
Had to stop at 7-Eleven like I needed gas
I'm lyin', I needed condoms, don't look through the glass
Chasin' love, all the bittersweet hours lost
Eatin' Asian pussy, all I need was sweet and sour sauce
Tell your boss you need an extra hour off
Get you super wet after we turn the shower off


That's all dem can do, say wah, say wah?
That's all dem can do
We deal with action ting
Just a badman ting, a dat man do
Action thing yo a badman thing

That's right (And your boys at your door)

Uh, I need you home when I get off
Uh, you know I need that wet mouth
Uh, I know you need that reptile
Uh, she cut from a different textile
Uh, she love different kinds of sex now
Uh, black girl sippin' white wine
Put my fist in her like a civil rights sign
And grabbed it with a slight grind
And held it till the right time
Then she came like aah!


That's why I'm in it and I can't get out
(That's all dem can do, say wah, say wah?)
That's why I'm in it and I can't get out

We deal with action ting
Just a badman thing, a dat man do)

Say you long for me, for you

Strange fruit hangin' from the poplar trees

Cause I ain't got the money on me right now

We could've been somebody (Strange fruit)
Thought you'd be different 'bout it (Hangin')
Now I know you not it (From the poplar trees)
So let's get on with it (From the poplar trees)

We could've been somebody
'Stead you had to tell somebody
Let's take it back to the first party
When you tried your first molly
And came out of your body
And came out of your body
Running naked down the lobby
And you was screamin' that you love me
Before the limelight tore ya
Before the limelight stole ya
Remember we were so young
When I would hold you
Before the blood on the leaves (Black bodies hangin' in the summer breeze, breeze)
I know there ain't wrong with me (Strange fruit hangin')
Something strange is happenin' (From the poplar trees)

You could've been somebody
We could've ugh, we could've been somebody
Or was it on the first party
When we tried our first molly
And came out of our body
And came out of our body
Before they call lawyers
Before you tried to destroy us
How you gon' lie to the lawyer?
It's like I don't even know ya
I gotta bring it back to the 'nolia


Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down with my niggas (Black bodies)
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down with my niggas (Hangin' in the summer breeze)
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down with my niggas (Breeze)

She Instagram herself like #BadBitchAlert
He Instagram his watch like #MadRichAlert
He only wanna see that ass in reverse
Two-thousand-dollar bag with no cash in your purse
Now you sittin' courtside, wifey on the other side
Gotta keep 'em separated, I call that apartheid
Then she said she impregnated, that's the night your heart died
Then you gotta go and tell your girl and report that
Main reason 'cause your pastor said you can't abort that
Now your driver say that new Benz you can't afford that
All that cocaine on the table you can't snort that
That goin' to that owin' money that the court got
All in on that alimony, uh, yeah-yeah, she got you homie, yeah
Till death but do your part, uh, unholy matrimony

Peekin' through the keyhole, the door locked by myself
And I'm feelin' it right now

Blocka, blocka, blocka-blocka, blocka
Pour a little champagne, cranberry vodka

Rockstar bitch call me Elvis
M.O.B, she call me selfish
Success got 'em jealous
Shorty's killin', while I'm drillin'
Tattoos, how they break the news
It was real if you made the news
Last night my bitches came in twos
And they both sucked like they came to lose
Dropped out the first day of school
'Cause niggas got cocaine to move
I be goin' hard, I got a name to prove
Killin' 'em, honey how I make the pain improve

Since "In da Club"
It's so packed I might ride around
On my bodyguard's back like Prince in the club
She say, "Can you get my friends in the club?"
I say, "Can you get my Benz in the club?"
If not, treat your friends like my Benz
Park they ass outside 'til the evenin' end
When I go raw, I like to leave it in
When I wake up, I like to go again
When I go to work, she gotta call it in
She can't go to work, same clothes again
And her heart colder than the souls of men
Louboutin on the toes again
Tight dress dancin' close to him
Yeezus just rose again

What you doin' in the club on a Thursday?
She say she only here for her girl birthday
They ordered champagne but still look thirsty
Rock Forever 21 but just turned thirty

I know I got a bad reputation
Walking-'round-always-mad reputation
Leave-a-pretty-girl-sad reputation
Start-a-Fight-Club-Brad reputation

I turnt the nightclub out of the basement
I'll turn the plane 'round, your ass keep complainin'
How you gon' be mad on vacation?
Dutty wining 'round all these Jamaicans

Uh, this that prom shit
This that what-we-do-don't-tell-your-mom shit
This that red-cup-all-on-the-lawn shit
Got a fresh cut, straight out the salon, bitch

With nobody to love, nobody, nobody



Close your eyes and let the word paint a thousand pictures
One good girl is worth a thousand bitches

I wanna fuck you hard on the sink
After that, give you somethin' to drink
Step back, can't get spunk on the mink
I mean damn, what would Jeromey Romey Romey Rome think?

Hey, you remember where we first met?
Okay, I don't remember where we first met
But hey, admittin' is the first step
And hey, you know ain't nobody perfect

And I know, with the hoes I got the worst rep
But hey, their backstroke I'm tryna perfect
And hey, ayo, we made it: Thanksgivin'
So hey, maybe we can make it to Christmas

She asked me what I wished for on my wishlist
Have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches?
Maybe we could still make it to the church steps
But first, you gon' remember how to forget
After all these long-ass verses
I'm tired, you tired, Jesus wept


I know you're tired of lovin', of lovin'
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody
So just grab somebody, no leavin' this party
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody
